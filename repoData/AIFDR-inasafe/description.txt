Any images you place in this directory will mask the default ones
provided in resources/en/user-docs. So add localised screenshots
as needed for user docs here.

The files in this folder were autogenerated from the inasafe-doc repo,
do NOT EDIT HERE!!!

These docs are shipped so that someone checking out the plugin from git will
have working docs, and also so that tests will work. When we create the
release build, we will build the user-docs from the inasafe-doc repo into the
release package.

See scripts/release.sh for more info on how we do this.

This is an area for files such as screenshots used to support InaSAFE
e.g. when issues need documentation.

It is intended to replace the download area that was discontinued in github on 11th December 2012: https://github.com/blog/1302-goodbye-uploads


InaSAFE
=======

InaSAFE is free software that allows disaster managers to study realistic
natural hazard impact scenarios for better planning, preparedness and
response activities. InaSAFE is a plugin for [QGIS](http://qgis.org).

For more information about InaSAFE please visit
[inasafe.org](http://www.inasafe.org) and look at the documentation at
[inasafe.readthedocs.org](http://inasafe.readthedocs.org>).

The latest source code is available at
[https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe](https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe),
which contains modules for risk calculations, GIS functionality and
functions for impact modelling.

Quick Installation Guide
========================

You first need to have [QGIS](http://qgis.org/) installed. Grab your free
copy from [the QGIS download page](http://download/qgis.org).

To install the InaSAFE plugin, use the plugin manager in
[QGIS](http://qgis.org):

  Plugins → Manage and Install Plugins → Get more tab

Then search for "InaSAFE", select it and click the install button.
The plugin will now be added to your plugins menu.

**Note:** You may need to restart QGIS if upgrading from a prior version.


System Requirements
-------------------

 - A standard PC with at least 4GB of RAM running Windows, Linux or Mac OS X
 - The QGIS Open Source Geographic Information System (http://www.qgis.org).
   InaSAFE requires QGIS version 1.7 or newer.

Limitations
===========

InaSAFE is a new project. The current code development started in
earnest in January 2012 and there is still much to be done.  However,
we work under the philosophy that stakeholders should have access to the
development and source code from the very beginning and invite
comments, suggestions and contributions.  See
[our milestones list](https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe/issues/milestones) and
[our open issues list](https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe/issues?page=1&state=open)
for known bugs and outstanding tasks.
