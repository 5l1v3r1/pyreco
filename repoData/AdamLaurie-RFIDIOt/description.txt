LS_NFC_CLient is an Android application that detects an NFC card and makes a network connection to obtain commands (APDUs) to run on that card.  It works by registering an intent for detection of ISODEP NFC cards, and then connecting to the server defined the application settings.  This can be changed in the client UI.


For the server component, you can use netcat to listen on the port and send APDUs manually.  Or you can use RFIDIOt with the pyandroid patch to send commands to the card.

The application has been tested on a Nexus S with the following types of cards:
- Electronic passports
- Paypass creditcards
- OTher ISO 14443 cards

You can also use RFIDIOt to make calls ro LS_NFC_Client by setting -R RFIDIOt.rfidiot.READER_ANDROID or modifying the RFIDIOtconfig.py

q: What is RFIDIOt?
a: A collection of tools and libraries for exploring RFID technology, written 
in python.

q: Why RFIDIOt?
a: I like silly puns. Also, I'm coming at this from an idiot's point of view: 
I know nothing about RFID tags, and even less about python. As such, I felt a 
complete idiot when I started. :)

q: How can I contribute?
a: Send me patches, info, new tools, coffee, money, drugs and/or loose women.

q: What hardware is supported?
a: So far this works with the ACG serial readers. I use the CF Card model, 
but it should also work with the USB version by changing the serial port to 
/dev/ttyUSB0. You can find more details here:

q: So what exactly is here?
a: Please see http://www.rfidiot.org/documentation.html
