Edit CSS Style plug-in notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unlike WYSIWYG editor functionality that operates only on the selected text,
typically by inserting new HTML elements with the specified styles.
This plug-in operates on the HTML blocks surrounding the selected text.
No new HTML elements are created.

This plug-in only operates on the surrounding blocks and not the nearest
parent node.  This means that if a block encapsulates a node,
e.g <p><span>text</span></p>, then only the styles in the block are
recognized, not those in the span.

When selecting text that includes multiple blocks at the same level (peers),
this plug-in accumulates the specified styles in all of the surrounding blocks
and populates the dialogue checkboxes accordingly.  There is no differentiation
between styles set in all the blocks versus styles set in some of the blocks.

When the [Update] or [Apply] buttons are pressed, the styles selected in the
checkboxes are applied to all blocks that surround the selected text.

Migration data is for guestbook application and neptune data.

Binary Distribution Notes

If you have just untarred a binary Go distribution, you need to set
the environment variable $GOROOT to the full path of the go
directory (the one containing this README).  You can omit the
variable if you unpack it into /usr/local/go, or if you rebuild
from sources by running all.bash (see doc/install.html).
You should also add the Go binary directory $GOROOT/bin
to your shell's path.

For example, if you extracted the tar file into $HOME/go, you might
put the following in your .profile:

    export GOROOT=$HOME/go
    export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin

See doc/install.html for more details.

1) ABOUT
========

This is the Python package 'antlr3', which is required to use parsers created
by the ANTLR3 tool. See <http://www.antlr.org/> for more information about
ANTLR3.


2) STATUS
=========

The Python target for ANTLR3 is still in beta. Documentation is lacking, some
bits of the code is not yet done, some functionality has not been tested yet.
Also the API might change a bit - it currently mimics the Java implementation,
but it may be made a bit more pythonic here and there.

WARNING: Currently the runtime library for V3.1 is not compatible with
recognizers generated by ANTLR V3.0.x. If you are an application developer,
then the suggested way to solve this is to package the correct runtime with
your application. Installing the runtime in the global site-packages directory
may not be a good idea.
It is still undetermined, if a future release of the V3.1 runtime will be
compatible with V3.0.x recognizers or if future runtimes V3.2+ will be
compatible with V3.1 recognizers.
Sorry for the inconvenience.


3) DOWNLOAD
===========

This runtime is part of the ANTLR distribution. The latest version can be found
at <http://www.antlr.org/download.html>.

If you are interested in the latest, most bleeding edge version, have a look at
the perforce depot at <http://fisheye2.cenqua.com/browse/antlr>. There are
tarballs ready to download, so you don't have to install the perforce client.


4) INSTALLATION
===============

Just like any other Python package:
$ python setup.py install

See <http://docs.python.org/inst/> for more information.


5) DOCUMENTATION
================

Documentation (as far as it exists) can be found in the wiki
<http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Antlr3PythonTarget>


6) REPORTING BUGS
=================

Please send bug reports to the ANTLR mailing list 
<http://www.antlr.org:8080/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest> or
<pink@odahoda.de>.

Existing bugs may appear someday in the bugtracker:
<http://www.antlr.org:8888/browse/ANTLR>


7) HACKING
==========

Only the runtime package can be found here. There are also some StringTemplate
files in 'src/org/antlr/codegen/templates/Python/' and some Java code in
'src/org/antlr/codegen/PythonTarget.java' (of the main ANTLR3 source
distribution).

If there are no directories 'tests' and 'unittests' in 'runtime/Python', you
should fetch the latest ANTLR3 version from the perforce depot. See section
DOWNLOAD.
You'll need java and ant in order to compile and use the tool.
Be sure to properly setup your CLASSPATH.
(FIXME: is there some generic information, how to build it yourself? I should
point to it to avoid duplication.)

You can then use the commands
$ python setup.py unittest
$ python setup.py functest
to ensure that changes do not break existing behaviour.

Please send patches to <pink@odahoda.de>. For larger code contributions you'll
have to sign the "Developer's Certificate of Origin", which can be found on
<http://www.antlr.org/license.html> or use the feedback form at
<http://www.antlr.org/misc/feedback>.

The argparse module makes it easy to write user friendly command line
interfaces.

The program defines what arguments it requires, and argparse will figure out
how to parse those out of sys.argv. The argparse module also automatically
generates help and usage messages and issues errors when users give the
program invalid arguments.

As of Python >= 2.7 and >= 3.2, the argparse module is maintained within the
Python standard library. For users who still need to support Python < 2.7 or
< 3.2, it is also provided as a separate package, which tries to stay
compatible with the module in the standard library, but also supports older
Python versions.

argparse is licensed under the Python license, for details see LICENSE.txt.


Compatibility
-------------

argparse should work on Python >= 2.3, it was tested on:

* 2.3.5, 2.4.4, 2.5.5, 2.6.5 and 2.7
* 3.1, 3.2


Installation
------------

Try one of these:

    python setup.py install

    easy_install argparse

    pip install argparse

    putting argparse.py in some directory listed in sys.path should also work


Bugs
----

If you find a bug, please try to reproduce it with python 2.7.

If it happens there also, please file a bug in the python.org issue tracker.
If it does not happen in 2.7, file a bug in the argparse package issue tracker.

This is python client library for Google's discovery based APIs.


Installation
============

To install, simply say

   $ easy_install --upgrade google-api-python-client


Running
=======

After following the install directions (using setup.py or setpath.sh) you
should be able to cd to samples/plus and run plus.py from there, which will use
the apiclient library to retrieve a snippet of text from each entry in Google
Plus. The first time you run it you will be prompted to authorize the
application to access your plus information.

   $ python samples/plus/plus.py


Third Party Libraries
=====================

These libraries will be installed when you install the client library:

http://code.google.com/p/httplib2
http://code.google.com/p/uri-templates
http://code.google.com/p/python-gflags
http://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2

Depending on your version of Python, these libraries may also be installed:

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/

For development you will also need:

http://pythonpaste.org/webtest/

The [Grizzled Python Utility Library][] is a general-purpose Python library
with a variety of different modules and packages. It's roughly organized
into subpackages that group different kinds of utility functions and
classes.

Grizzled is copyright &copy; 2008-2010 by Brian M. Clapper and is released
under a BSD license.

The tests in this directory are intended to be run via Nose.

ipaddr.py is a library for working with IP addresses, both IPv4 and IPv6.
It was developed by Google for internal use, and is now open source.

Project home page: http://code.google.com/p/ipaddr-py/

Please send contributions to ipaddr-py-dev@googlegroups.com.  Code should
include unit tests and follow the Google Python style guide:
http://code.google.com/p/soc/wiki/PythonStyleGuide

Flask Sphinx Styles
===================

This repository contains sphinx styles for Flask and Flask related
projects.  To use this style in your Sphinx documentation, follow
this guide:

1. put this folder as _themes into your docs folder.  Alternatively
   you can also use git submodules to check out the contents there.
2. add this to your conf.py:

   sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('_themes'))
   html_theme_path = ['_themes']
   html_theme = 'flask'

The following themes exist:

- 'flask' - the standard flask documentation theme for large
  projects
- 'flask_small' - small one-page theme.  Intended to be used by
  very small addon libraries for flask.

The following options exist for the flask_small theme:

   [options]
   index_logo = ''              filename of a picture in _static
                                to be used as replacement for the
                                h1 in the index.rst file.
   index_logo_height = 120px    height of the index logo
   github_fork = ''             repository name on github for the
                                "fork me" badge

MarkupSafe
==========

Implements a unicode subclass that supports HTML strings:

>>> from markupsafe import Markup, escape
>>> escape("<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>")
Markup(u'&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie);&lt;/script&gt;')
>>> tmpl = Markup("<em>%s</em>")
>>> tmpl % "Peter > Lustig"
Markup(u'<em>Peter &gt; Lustig</em>')

If you want to make an object unicode that is not yet unicode
but don't want to lose the taint information, you can use the
`soft_unicode` function:

>>> from markupsafe import soft_unicode
>>> soft_unicode(42)
u'42'
>>> soft_unicode(Markup('foo'))
Markup(u'foo')

Objects can customize their HTML markup equivalent by overriding
the `__html__` function:

>>> class Foo(object):
...  def __html__(self):
...   return '<strong>Nice</strong>'
...
>>> escape(Foo())
Markup(u'<strong>Nice</strong>')
>>> Markup(Foo())
Markup(u'<strong>Nice</strong>')

Since MarkupSafe 0.10 there is now also a separate escape function
called `escape_silent` that returns an empty string for `None` for
consistency with other systems that return empty strings for `None`
when escaping (for instance Pylons' webhelpers).

If you also want to use this for the escape method of the Markup
object, you can create your own subclass that does that::

    from markupsafe import Markup, escape_silent as escape

    class SilentMarkup(Markup):
        __slots__ = ()

        @classmethod
        def escape(cls, s):
            return cls(escape(s))

The list of files here isn't complete.  For a step-by-step guide on
how to set this package up correctly, check out
    http://www.debian.org/doc/maint-guide/

Most of the files that are in this directory are boilerplate.
However, you may need to change the list of binary-arch dependencies
in 'rules'.

This repository contains a python implementation of the Google commandline
flags module.

 GFlags defines a *distributed* command line system, replacing systems like
 getopt(), optparse and manual argument processing. Rather than an application
 having to define all flags in or near main(), each python module defines flags
 that are useful to it.  When one python module imports another, it gains
 access to the other's flags.

 It includes the ability to define flag types (boolean, float, interger, list),
 autogeneration of help (in both human and machine readable format) and reading
 arguments from a file. It also includes the ability to automatically generate
 man pages from the help flags.

Documentation for implementation is at the top of gflags.py file.

To install the python module, run
   python ./setup.py install

When you install this library, you also get a helper application,
gflags2man.py, installed into /usr/local/bin.  You can run gflags2man.py to
create an instant man page, with all the commandline flags and their docs, for
any C++ or python program you've written using the gflags library.

USING THE SDK
=======================
For instructions on getting started with Google App Engine, please see the
Google App Engine Getting Started Guide

https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted


USING THE APP ENGINE LAUNCHER
=============================
The Windows and Mac OSX Python SDKs include an additional development tool
called the App Engine Launcher.  This tool provides a simple graphical
interface to create projects, run them locally, and deploy them to Google's App
Engine servers. It can be used in place of the dev_appserver and appcfg
command-line tools.

The Windows SDK can optionally install a desktop short-cut during
installation. If you are missing the short-cut, you can find the launcher in
the launcher subdirectory of your App Engine installation. The default
location is
C:\Program Files\Google\google_appengine\launcher\GoogleAppEngineLauncher.exe

In Mac OSX, the Launcher is installed by dragging it out of the .dmg to a
location specified by the user. The Launcher contains the SDK inside of it.
A typical drag-install destination for the Launcher and SDK is
/Applications/GoogleAppEngineLauncher.app

The results of adding a task are async to the actually enqueuing. 
Tail to see it in action:
root@appscale-image0:/var/log/appscale/celery_workers# tail -f test_app.log
