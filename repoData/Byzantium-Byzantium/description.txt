This is v0.1 alpha of Byzantium Linux (codenamed 'Scarab').  We're not 
finished with it - not by a long shot!  There are bugs that have yet to be 
found and fixed and things that need to be added and polished before it's 
ready for prime time.  We'll probably change some things in the next release, 
too.  A number of important things still need to be added so this release is 
not as usable as we wanted it to be.  Still, we wanted to get Byzantium into 
the hands of users to prove that it could be done, and to get feedback on our 
work.  If you are in a situation where life and limb are at risk, DO NOT 
trust Byzantium to be safe yet!

DO NOT TRUST BYZANTIUM TO PROTECT YOU!  THIS IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT RELEASE 
ONLY!

Basic instructions for setting up and running Byzantium:

Please read before starting Byzantium!

 * Download the .iso image: 
http://wiki.hacdc.org/index.php/Downloading_Byzantium
 * Burn the image to disk:
   * Insert a blank CD- or DVD-ROM in your burner.
   * Start your disk burning or creation utility and select the 'burn image 
     to disk' function.
   * When prompted, choose byzantium-v0.1a.iso
   * Burn the file to disk.
   * Examine the disk to ensure that it contains folders called /boot and 
     /porteus.  If it doesn't something went wrong.
 * Or, install to a formatted USB key:
   * Windows
     * Extract the contents of the Byzantium .iso image using 7zip, WinRAR, 
       .iso mastering software to the USB key.
     * If you are more familiar with .iso mastering software, use that to 
       copy the files out of the image onto the USB key.
     * If you prefer to use CD emulation software, mount the .iso in that and 
       copy the files that way.
     * On the USB key, run the script /boot/win_start_here.hta and follow the 
       directions.
   * Linux
     * Mount the .iso image to one of your /dev/loop devices
     * Alternatively, open the .iso image with your file manager of choice.
     * Copy all of the files onto a USB key (for now, I'll assume it's 
       mounted under /mnt/key).
     * cd /mnt/key/boot
     * sudo ./lin_start_here.sh
     * Follow the instructions on the screen.
 * Ensure that your computer will boot from the CD or DVD-ROM drive first.  
   If it will not, change the BIOS settings so that this will be the case.  Or, 
   hit the appropriate key on your keyboard during boot to open the boot device 
   selection menu and choose your CD or DVD-ROM drive.
 * Boot your computer from the Byzantium media.
 * When the desktop appears, start Firefox.
 * Go to the URL http://localhost:8080/
 * Click on "Configure Network Interface".
 * Click the button for your wireless card (usually wlan0, but it might be 
   different for you).
 * Enter a ESSID and wireless channel.  By default, they are 'Byzantium' and 
   channel 3.
 * Byzantium will generate a network configuration for the node.  Please be 
   patient, this may take a while.
 * Confirm that you want to configure the node with the parameters it has.  
   Note the client address of the node (it'll start with "10.").
 * Click on "Configure Mesh Networking".
 * Click on your configured wireless interface.
 * Click 'Enable'.
 * Cick on "System Services"
 * Pick something you want to start - the Microblog, an IRC server (this will 
   then require you to start Web Chat), or Etherpad and click the 'Activate' 
   button next to it.  You can start SSH if you want but this is a security 
   vulnerability, so please don't do this unless you have to.
 * Connect some wireless devices (like another laptop or netbook) to your 
   mesh.  They need to be capable of ad-hoc wireless mode for this to work (for 
   now).
 * Have them connect to the client IP of your Byzantium node and experiment 
   with the services running on it.
 * Neighboring Byzantium nodes should find one another and automatically link 
   up so long as they're on the same wireless channel and ESSID.

Thanks to the Porteus Linux development team for the basic framework for this 
document.


乱七八网说明:

*下载 .iso
http://wiki.hacdc.org/index.php/Downloading_Byzantium
*用.iso 刻光盘:
*启动刻光盘程序
   *提示时, 选 byzantium-v0.1a.iso
   *刻光盘后, 查光盘.  要是没有/boot 和 /porteus  的 日录, 就有问题.
*也可以用U盘安装:
   *WINDOWS:
      *用解缩软件(7ZIP,RAR)放文件到U盘.
      * U盘上, 开 /boot/win_start_here.hta 小程序
   *LINUX:
         *mount .iso 到 /dev/loop 的一个设备或用文件管理器开.iso
         *放内容到U盘
     * cd /mnt/key/boot
     * sudo ./lin_start_here.sh
         *按照屏幕上的说明安装 
*让电脑从 CD 或者 DVDROM 启动.  要是有问题, 检查BIOS 配置
*用乱七八网[光盘, U盘, 等] 启动电脑
*启动后， 开FIREFOX
*[browse] 到 http://localhost:8080/
*单击"Configure Network Interface"
*击你无线网卡的选题(常常是wlan0, 但可能是不同.)
*写ESSID和无线网管道.  默认是 ‘byzantium’ 和 管道3.
*乱七八网就生产节点的网络配置.  等几分钟.
*确定节点的参数是正确的.记住客户的地址.  (应该有”10.”在头)
*单击"Configure Mesh Networking"
*单击你已配置好了的无线网络接口
*单击'Enable'
*单击"System Services"
*选什么你要启动的程序: 博客, IRC(需要启动webchat),等 , 就击’activate’.  [小心]用SSH - 可能是安全漏洞!
*把另无线网设备加入MESH.  设备一定需要AD HOC 无线网方式.  (未来可能不需要)
*让无线网设备用客户IP联系到乱七八网节点.  
*乱七八网节点应该自由的招呼兄弟, 自动的联系.  

Customizations to MySQL (such as a my.cnf file) go here.

Avahi is an implementation of the DNS Service Discovery and Multicast DNS
specifications for Zeroconf Computing.  It uses D-BUS for communication
between user applications and a system daemon.  The daemon is used to
coordinate application efforts in caching replies, necessary to minimize
the traffic imposed on networks.  This kind of technology is already
found in Apple MacOS X (branded Rendezvous Bonjour and sometimes Zeroconf)
and is very convenient.

You will need to have an "avahi" user and group on the target system
prior to installing the avahi package.  See README.SBo in this directory
(it is also installed to the package docmentation directory) for more
information and for setup notes.

mono is an optional dependency that also requires gtk-sharp - enable it
with the following:  "MONO=yes ./avahi.SlackBuild"

README.SBo (avahi)

First, be sure you have an "avahi" user and group.  Do this *before*
you install the avahi package.  We recommend uid/gid of 214, but 
adjust as needed for your system.  Something like this should suffice:

  # groupadd -g 214 avahi
  # useradd -u 214 -g 214 -c "Avahi User" -d /dev/null -s /bin/false avahi


Now start the Avahi daemon:

	# /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidaemon start

Optionally start the unicast DNS configuration daemon:

	# /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidnsconfd start


You will need to start avahi at boot by adding the following 
to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local and make them executable:

        # Start avahidaemon
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidaemon ]; then
	  /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidaemon start
	fi
        # Start avahidnsconfd
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidnsconfd ]; then
	  /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidnsconfd start
	fi

You will also want to put the following into /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown
(if that file does not exist, create it and make it executable):

        # Stop avahidnsconfd
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidnsconfd ]; then
	  /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidnsconfd stop
	fi
        # Stop avahidaemon
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidaemon ]; then
	  /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidaemon stop
	fi


Broadcom's wireless chip(s) firmware.

See project homepage http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/b43
for technical details and copyright information.

b43-fwcutter is a tool to extract Broadcom's wireless chip(s) firmware.

batctl (B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced control and management tool)

The B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced routing protocol has been included in the
Linux kernel since 2.6.38, however the kernel module is only part of
of the implementation. In order to create and configure mesh networks
using the B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced protocol you need the batctl userland
tool.

Since B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced operates on layer 2 the common diagnosis
tools do not work as expected. To solve this, batctl provides
alternatives for ping, traceroute, and tcpdump.

The broadcom-sta package includes the kernel module 'wl', which contains
the Broadcom-provided proprietary kernel driver that supports a number of
their cards.  Known supported model numbers include the BCM4311, BCM4312,
BCM4321, and BCM4322 chipsets.

Read the included LICENSE.txt file (placed in /usr/doc) before using this.

You may also want to create /etc/modprobe.d/b43_blacklist.conf and add the 
following lines to it:
    blacklist b43
    blacklist b43legacy
    blacklist bcma
    blacklist ssb

CELT is a very low delay audio codec designed for high-quality
communications. Traditional full-bandwidth  codecs such as Vorbis and
AAC can offer high quality but they require codec delays of hundreds
of milliseconds, which makes them unsuitable  for real-time
interactive applications like teleconferencing. Speech targeted
codecs, such as Speex or G.722, have lower 20-40ms delays but their
speech focus and limited sampling rates restricts their quality,
especially for music.

CherryPy is a pythonic, object-oriented HTTP framework.
CherryPy allows developers to build web applications in
much the same way they would build any other object-oriented
Python program. This results in smaller source code
developed in less time.

RSA Security Inc. PKCS #11 Cryptographic Token Interface (Cryptoki)
2.20 header files.

This standard specifies an API, called Cryptoki, to devices which hold
cryptographic information and perform cryptographic functions. Cryptoki,
pronounced crypto-key and short for cryptographic token interface,
follows a simple object-based approach, addressing the goals of
technology independence (any kind of device) and resource sharing
(multiple applications accessing multiple devices), presenting to
applications a common, logical view of the device called a cryptographic
token.

Erlang is a general-purpose concurrent programming language and runtime 
system. The sequential subset of Erlang is a functional language, with 
strict evaluation, single assignment, and dynamic typing. It was designed 
by Ericsson to support distributed, fault-tolerant, soft-real-time, 
non-stop applications.

The International Components for Unicode (ICU)libraries provide robust
and full-featured Unicode services on a wide variety of platforms.

IP sets are a framework inside the Linux 2.4.x and 2.6.x kernel, 
which can be administered by the ipset utility. Depending on the type,
currently an IP set may store IP addresses, (TCP/UDP) port numbers
or IP addresses with MAC addresses in a way, which ensures lightning
speed when matching an entry against a set.

If you want to:

* store multiple IP addresses or port numbers and match against
  the collection by iptables at one swoop;
* dynamically update iptables rules against IP addresses or ports
  without performance penalty;
* express complex IP address and ports based rulesets with one
  single iptables rule and benefit from the speed of IP sets 

then ipset may be the proper tool for you.

IP sets was written by Jozsef Kadlecsik and it is based on ippool
by Joakim Axelsson, Patrick Schaaf and Martin Josefsson.

This requires kernel-source.

The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function
when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout
has been reached. Furthermore, libevent also support callbacks due
to signals or regular timeouts.

libmcrypt (encryption functions for MCrypt)

mcrypt is a program for encrypting files or streams. It is intended
to be a replacement for the old UNIX crypt. It uses well-known and
well-tested algorithms like BLOWFISH, AES, ARCFOUR, CAST-128, and
more in several modes or operation.

This package is configured with --disable-posix-threads. Using the worker
or event MPM with apache can lead to instability when using mod_php and
non-thread-safe extensions. The flag can be safely removed from the
slackbuild when the prefork MPM is used, or when apache will not be installed
or running on the target machine.

See http://php.net/manual/en/mcrypt.installation.php for more details.

GNU libmicrohttpd is a small C library that is supposed to make it easy to run
an HTTP server as part of another application. GNU libmicrohttpd is free
software and part of the GNU project. Key features that distinguish
libmicrohttpd from other projects are:

* C library: fast and small
* API is simple, expressive and fully reentrant
* Implementation is http 1.1 compliant
* HTTP server can listen on multiple ports
* Support for IPv6
* Support for incremental processing of POST data
* Creates binary of only 30k (without TLS/SSL support)
* Three different threading models
* Supported platforms include GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, OS X, W32,
  Symbian and z/OS
* Optional support for SSL3 and TLS (requires libgcrypt)

libmicrohttpd was started because the author needed an easy way to add a
concurrent HTTP server to other projects. Existing alternatives were either
non-free, not reentrant, standalone, of terrible code quality or a combination
thereof. Do not use libmicrohttpd if you are looking for a standalone http
server, there are many other projects out there that provide that kind of
functionality already. However, if you want to be able to serve simple WWW
pages from within your C or C++ application, check it out.

libmicrohttpd is licensed under the GNU LGPL. If you disable HTTPS/SSL
support, you can also choose the second license, the eCos License.

Lua is a free software light-weight programming language designed
for extending applications. Lua is also frequently used as a
general-purpose, stand-alone scripting language.

Mako is a template library written in Python. It provides a familiar,
non-XML syntax which compiles into Python modules for maximum performance.
Mako's syntax and API borrows from the best ideas of many others, including
Django templates, Cheetah, Myghty, and Genshi. Conceptually, Mako is an
embedded Python (i.e. Python Server Page) language, which refines the
familiar ideas of componentized layout and inheritance to produce one of
the most straightforward and flexible models available, while also
maintaining close ties to Python calling and scoping semantics.

This requires pysetuptools and MarkupSafe.

MarkupSafe implements a unicode subclass that supports HTML strings.

MarkupSafe requires pysetuptools.

Mumble is a voice chat application for groups. While it can be used
for any kind of activity, it is primarily intended for gaming. It
can be compared to programs like Ventrilo or TeamSpeak. 

If you have g15tools installed and want mumble to use it:
    G15=yes ./mumble.SlackBuild

If you want the mumble overlay:
    OVERLAY=yes ./mumble.SlackBuild

Please note, if you have celt-0.7.1, the previous version of celt on
SBo, you will need to upgrade to celt >= 0.11.0.

This requires: protobuf, speex, and celt >= 0.11.0

Note: This does not build the mumble server (murmur).

Murmur is the VoIP server component for Mumble. Murmur is
installed in a system-wide fashion, but can also be run by
individual users. Each murmur process supports multiple virtual
servers, each with their own user base and channel list.
Administration of murmur is done through D-Bus.

To run murmur at boot, add the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.murmur ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.murmur start
fi

nginx [engine x] is a high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy
as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server.

By default, nginx will use the "nobody" user and group accounts. You may
specify alternate values on the command line if desired; for example:

	NGINXUSER=backup NGINXGROUP=backup ./nginx.SlackBuild

Regardless of which user and group you decide to use, you will need to make
sure they exist on both the build system and the target system.

ngircd (Next Generation IRC Daemon)

ngIRCd is a portable IRC daemon written from scratch.  It is easy to
configure, supports server links (even with original ircds), and runs
on hosts with changing IP addresses (such as dial-in networks).

This defaults to using gnutls for SSL support; if you prefer to use
openssl (which will result in a non-redistributable package), then
pass "SSLTYPE=openssl" to the script when running it.

Node is a toolkit for writing extremely high performance non-blocking event
driven network servers in JavaScript.  Node is built on V8 JavaScript engine.

nss-mdns is a plugin for the GNU Name Service Switch (NSS) functionality
of the GNU C Library (glibc) which provides host name resolution via
Multicast DNS (a.k.a. Zeroconf, a.k.a. Apple Rendezvous, a.k.a Apple Bonjour).
This effectively allows name resolution by common Unix/Linux programs in the
ad-hoc mDNS domain .local.

To test, the following command should return a mapping for the remote host:
  getent hosts <hostname>.local

This requires avahi.

pip is a replacement for easy_install (from pysetuptools).  It uses mostly
the same techniques for finding packages, so packages that were made
easy_installable should be pip-installable as well.

pip is meant to improve on easy_install.  Some of the improvements:

- All packages are downloaded before installation.  Partially-completed
  installation doesn't occur as a result.
- Care is taken to present useful output on the console.
- The reasons for actions are kept track of.  For instance, if a package is
  being installed, pip keeps track of why that package was required.
- Error messages should be useful.
- The code is relatively concise and cohesive, making it easier to use
  programmatically.
- Packages don't have to be installed as egg archives, they can be
  installed flat (while keeping the egg metadata).
- Native support for other version control systems (Git, Mercurial and
  Bazaar).
- Uninstallation of packages.
- Simple to define fixed sets of requirements and reliably reproduce a set
  of packages.

pip is complementary with virtualenv, and it is encouraged that you use
virtualenv to isolate your installation.

protobuf (Google's data interchange format)

Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for
serializing structured data, think XML, but smaller, faster, and
simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once,
then you can use special generated source code to easily write and
read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams
and using a variety of languages. You can even update your data
structure without breaking deployed programs that are compiled
against the "old" format.

pysetuptools is a required dependency unless you disable python
support by running the build with "PYTHON=no ./protobuf.SlackBuild"
By default we build the python libraries because a few programs 
require it.

Erlang is a general-purpose concurrent programming language and runtime 
system. The sequential subset of Erlang is a functional language, with 
strict evaluation, single assignment, and dynamic typing. It was designed 
by Ericsson to support distributed, fault-tolerant, soft-real-time, 
non-stop applications.

Python wrapper around a small subset of the OpenSSL library. Includes:
X509 Certificates, SSL Context objects, SSL Connection objects using
Python sockets as transport layer. The Connection object wraps all the
socket methods and can therefore be used in.

pysetuptools (a collection of enhancements to Python distutils)
Note: the name of the source package is 'setuptools'.  Since 'setuptools'
is such a generic name, this package uses the name 'pysetuptools' to avoid
any potential future conflicts.  The actual installation paths and file 
names are not modified in any way.

setuptools allow you to more easily build and distribute Python packages,
especially ones that have dependencies on other packages.

Packages built and distributed using setuptools look to the user like ordinary
Python packages based on the distutils. Your users don't need to install or
even know about setuptools in order to use them, and you don't have to include
the entire setuptools package in your distributions. By including just a single
bootstrap module (an 8K .py file), your package will automatically download and
install setuptools if the user is building your package from source and doesn't
have a suitable version already installed.

Requires:  >=python-2.3.5 on 32-bit systems  >=python-2.4 on 64-bit systems

The Python module called sh (https://github.com/amoffat/sh) lets you call just about anything
that you could run from a login shell much more neatly than you can with subprocess.Popen, and
more importantly lets you capture and parse the output much more readily.  You use it like this:

    from sh import ifconfig
    print ifconfig("eth0")

Whatever command you want to run is imported like any other module.  That command is then usable
just like a Python statement.  Arguments are passed per usual, and output can be captured and
worked with in a like fashion.

It's written for Python v2.6 - v3.2, so future compatibility shouldn't be a problem.

Please note that this module is dependent on the value of the PATH variable in the underlying
shell, so if you don't have /sbin in $PATH, then trying to run anything in that directory will
result in exceptions being thrown.

Twisted is an event-driven networking engine written in Python and licensed
under the MIT license.

Twisted projects variously support TCP, UDP, SSL/TLS, multicast, Unix
sockets, a large number of protocols (including HTTP, NNTP, IMAP, SSH,
IRC, FTP, and others), and much more.

This requires zope.interface at runtime.

pyyaml (YAML parser and emitter for Python)

YAML is a data serialization  format  designed for  human readability
and interaction with scripting languages. PyYAML is a YAML parser and
emitter for Python.


RRDTool is the industry standard data logging and graphing application.

This package makes all bindings that are supported on the system.
Bindings for lua will be made automatically if it is detected.

Skype is a free Voice Over IP program for Linux, Windows and MacOS.
It allows users to communicate with other Skype users running any of
the supported platforms, as well as receiving and placing calls from
and to normal land lines and mobile phones.

This script repackages the shared tarball provided by Skype, which
has been built dynamically. For more information on how to repackage
a static version, check README.STATIC which came with this package.

By default this SlackBuild is going to build a dynamically linked skype
package, but in some cases a staticly linked one might be preferred.

First, get the skype_static tarball from here:

http://download.skype.com/linux/skype_static-4.0.0.8.tar.bz2
(md5sum: f749e1c109fbe182b44d462d04f46bee)

Then run skype.SlackBuild like this:
  STATIC=yes ./skype.SlackBuild

Note that the static version requires libtiff.so.4 which does not come
with slackware (yet), so we have to trick it with:
  ln -s /usr/lib/libtiff.so /usr/lib/libtiff.so.4

Enjoy :-)

Speex is an Open Source/Free Software patent-free audio compression
format designed for speech. The Speex Project aims to lower the barrier
of entry for voice applications by providing a free alternative to 
expensive proprietary speech codecs. Moreover, Speex is well-adapted 
to Internet applications and provides useful features that are not 
present in most other codecs. Finally, Speex is part of the GNU  
Project and is available under the revised BSD license.

SQLite Database Browser is a freeware, public domain, open source visual
tool used to create, design and edit database files compatible with
SQLite. It is meant to be used for users and developers that want to
create databases, edit and search data using a familiar spreadsheet-like
interface, without the need to learn complicated SQL commands.

Tor is a toolset for a wide range of organizations and people that want
to improve their safety and security on the Internet. Using Tor can help
you anonymize web browsing and publishing, instant messaging, IRC,
SSH, and other applications that use the TCP protocol. Tor also
provides a platform on which software developers can build new
applications with built-in anonymity, safety, and privacy features.

This script requires a 'tor' user/group to exist before running.
The recommended UID/GID is 220. You can create these like so:
  groupadd -g 220 tor
  useradd -u 220 -g 220 -c "The Onion Router" -d /dev/null -s /bin/false tor

You can pass another user/group to the script; this is however, less safe:
  TOR_USER=nobody TOR_GROUP=nogroup sh tor.SlackBuild

The following can be used to start/stop tor automatically:
/etc/rc.d/rc.local
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.tor ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.tor start
  fi

/etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.tor ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.tor stop
  fi

Tor requires libevent, while tsocks is an optional run-time dependency if you
want to use the "torify" shell script.

Take a look at README.SLACKWARE for important notes and recent changes.

As of tor-0.2.1.30-2 and later, I've updated Tor rc.tor init script to get rid
of hardcoded values present inside torctl command script. To successfully use
the newer script be sure to check changes to both /etc/rc.d/rc.tor.new and
/etc/tor/torrc.new as some configurations values are now required and no
longer passed on the command line. The original TorProject.org torrc
configuration is always available as /etc/tor/torrc.sample.

Also, there has been a recent libevent upgrade from 1.4.13 to 2.0.10 in
SlackBuilds.org 13.37 tree, remember to rebuild Tor when such major upgrades
happen.

TrueCrypt is free open-source disk encryption software for
Windows Vista/XP, Mac OS X, and Linux.

Since version 6.1a of TrueCrypt, a number of header files from RSA
Laboratories are required during the compilation. I've separated the
installation of these into a separate package called cryptoki rather
than have this script extract a separate, isolated archive. 

Thus, to build this version of TrueCrypt, you also need cryptoki, and
to run Truecrypt you need wxGTK. Both are available at SlackBuilds.org.

This script does not create the static GUI build seen elsewhere (see
above for required runtime dependency of wxGTK or similar).

NOTE: There is no direct link to the TrueCrypt source archive, as such, 
it must be downloaded manually from within a web browser.

tsocks' role is to allow these non SOCKS aware applications (e.g telnet, ssh,
ftp etc) to use SOCKS without any modification. It does this by intercepting
the calls that applications make to establish network connections and
negotating them through a SOCKS server as necessary.

Virtualenv is a tool to create isolated Python environments.

Virtualenv can optionally use distribute or Python 3 during install.

wxGTK is part of wxWidgets, a cross-platform API for writing GUI
applications on multiple platforms that still utilize the native platform's
controls and utilities.

This is a unicode shared build.  If you do not want the unicode build, use:
  UNICODE=NO ./wxGTK.SlackBuild

If you want to include the media library, which provides bindings for
gstreamer, you will need to install GConf first.

This package conflicts with wxPython because wxGTK is already included
there. Both cannot be installed at the same time!

ZOPE Interfaces are a mechanism for labeling objects as conforming to a
given API or contract.

This requires pysetuptools, and zope.testing is an optional dependency
if you want to run the test suite.

# ANNOUNCING BYZANTIUM LINUX V0.5b (Sleep Deprivation)
### Approved for: GENERAL RELEASE, DISTRIBUTION UNLIMITED

Project Byzantium, a working group of HacDC (http://hacdc.org/) is proud to announce the release of v0.5 beta of Byzantium Linux, a live distribution of Linux which makes it fast and easy to construct an ad-hoc wireless mesh network which can augment or replace the existing telecommunications infrastructure in the event that it is knocked offline (for example, due to a natural disaster) or rendered untrustworthy (through widespread surveillance or disconnection by hostile entities). This release was developed in the days following Hurricane Sandy, and was perfected while the core development team was assisting with disaster relief efforts in the Red Hook neighborhood of New York City in November of 2012.

Byzantium Linux is designed to run on any x86 computer with at least one 802.11 a/b/g/n wireless interface. Byzantium can be burned to a CD- or DVD-ROM (the .iso image is a bit over 370 megabytes in size), booted from an external hard drive, or can even be installed in parallel with an existing operating system without risk to the user's data and software. Byzantium Linux will act as a node of the mesh and will automatically connect to other mesh nodes and act as an access point for wifi-enabled mobile devices. This release of Byzantium Linux also incorporates seamless interoperability with mesh networks constructed using the Commotion Wireless (https://commotionwireless.net/) firmware.
