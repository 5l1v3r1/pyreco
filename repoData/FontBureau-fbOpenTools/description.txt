<p>This extension overlays combining or floating accents over the Current Glyph, based on the name and position of the anchors. As you move an anchor, the accent visualization will move with it. This extension is tailored very closely to my naming habits and workflow, so your mileage my vary. The goal is to store all the knowledge about accents in the base glyphs, so I have to do as little fiddling as possible in the accent glyphs.</p>

<p>I am working on an upgrade of this tool that will also build and update the accent glyphs that it visualizes.</p>

<p>If your accent glyphs are already built, the extension will allow you to compare your existing composite glyph to what would be generated using the anchor positioning.</p>

<p>The interface gives you basic options for fill, stroke, and color. It also allows you to toggle the left, center, and right vertical guides. If you select one or more accents in the list, only those accents will be visualized in the Glyph Window. The reset button will return the glyph to its default view.</p>

<p>By default, the extension looks for anchors named "top" and "bottom", corresponding to "_top" and "_bottom" anchors in the combining/floating accents themselves. Double clicking on an accent in the list will create a new anchor specifically for that diacritic (for example, "top_acutecmb"), which is helpful with ogoneks and carons that don't sit with other accents.</p>

<p>Adjust Metrics was created in 2012 by David Jonathan Ross for Font Bureau. It may or may not work the way you want it to.</p> 

   
<p>Adjust both margins, left margin, or right margin...</p>
<p>To current glyph selection or all glyphs</p>
<p>In current font or a selection of opened fonts</p>
    
<h2>Options:</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Adjust components (on by default):</dt> <dd>If 'A' is selected but not 'Aacute', 'Aacute' will be shifted back so it does not affect the original position.</dd>
    
<dt>Adjust Comps with Selected (off by default):</dt> <dd>If 'A' is selected, also transform 'Aacute' et. al.</dd>

<p>A subclass of the Robofont Editing Tool, Bounding Tool helps you visualize the bounding box of your current glyph. It will also display the box's dimensions, thanks to <a href="http://www.ninastoessinger.com/?l=e">Nina Stössinger</a>. You can use the division sliders if you are trying to center something, or divide something evenly into halves, thirds, or quarters.</p>

<p><em>Note: I changed some things that might cause the icon to disappear when you install the new version.
Please uninstall previous versions of Bounding Tool (listed in Prefs > Extensions > Extensions), quit RoboFont, reopen RoboFont, and finally, double-click or drag to install the latest extension). Sorry about that!
</em></p>


<p>The dialog box gives you some options:</p>

<dl>

<dt>View All or Selected</dt>
<dd>Toggle between getting the bounding box for the entire glyph vs. the current selection. The entire glyph is useful for centering accents, etc.</dd>

<dt>Use Italic</dt>
<dd>Use the font's italic angle to display a slanted bounding box.</dd>


<dt>View X and/or Y (checkboxes)</dt>
<dd>Toggle on/off the x and y axis.</dd>

<dt>Number of Divisions</dt>
<dd>Choose whether to split the bounding box into halves, thirds, or quarters, or to not split it.</dd>

<dt>Show Coordinates</dt>
<dd>Toggle the display of bounding coordinates.</dd>

<dt>Show Dimensions</dt>
<dd>Toggle the display of the bounding box's dimensions.</dd>


<dt>Div Guides</dt>
<dd>Convert the current divisions into guides, which will stick around after the tool is deactivated.</dd>

<dt>Box Guides</dt>
<dd>Convert the bounding box square into guides, which will stick around after the tool is deactivated.</dd>

<p>Search for glyphs using a variety of parameters:</p>

<dl>

<dt>Glyph Name:</dt>
<dd>Exact match for glyph name.</dd>

<dt>Base Name:</dt>
<dd>Exact match for the basename of the glyph (anything before the first period in a glyph name)</dd>

<dt>Suffix</dt>
<dd>Exact match for the suffix of the glyph name (anything after the first period).</dd>

<dt>Unicode value</dt>
<dd>Find exact match for hexadecimal unicode value.</dd>

<dt>Unicode category</dt>
<dd>The unicode category groups and individual categories are listed in a dropdown.<br /> 
You might have to hit enter/return in the dropdown to select an item.
These categories are inclusive, so they will match base glyphs and alternates ("number" will match 'zero' and also 'zero.sups').</dd> 

<p>You can use the following wildcards:</p>
<dl>
<dt>*</dt><dd>matches everything</dd>
<dt>?</dt><dd>matches any single character</dd>
<dt>[seq]</dt><dd>matches any character in seq</dd>
<dt>[!seq]</dt><dd>matches any character not in seq</dd>
</dl>

<p>Then you can manually select glyphs (by default, all search results are selected)</p>

<p>You can perform the following selection manipulations in the current font or in all open fonts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Replace selection with results</li>
<li>Add results to selection</li>
<li>Subtract results from selection</li>
<li>Intersect results and seletion (select glyphs common to both) </li>
<li>Print the glyph list to the output window.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Italic Bowtie</h2>

<img src="ItalicBowtie_sample.png" style="max-width: 600px" />

<p>This extension helps with creating Italics on the font and glyph level, while drawing a "bowtie" in the Current Glyph Window to show the relationship of a font’s vertical and slanted sidebearings.</p>


<h2>Font Adjustments</h2>

<p>First, Set the italic angle you want in the Italic Bowtie dialog (usually a negative number).</p>

<p>Then determine your Cross Height. In your Current Glyph Window, you will see this value represented as the vertical height where the bowtie shape crosses itself. Press “Mid UC” to set the Cross Height to half of the cap height, which will offset the italic until your capitals are centered between vertical sidebearings. Alternatively, press “Mid LC” to set the Cross Height to half of the x-height, which will offset the italic until your lowercase is centered between vertical sidebearings. </p>

<p>Once the Cross Height is set, the extension will determine the appropriate Italic Slant Offset for this arrangement.</p>

<p>Once you have Italic Angle and Italic Slant Offset values that you are happy with, you can set them in the Current Font or All Open Fonts by pressing “Set Font Italic Values”.</p>


<h2>Glyph Adjustments</h2>

<p>The italicize button will skew and offset your Current Glyph, Selected Glyphs, or All Glyphs in either the Current Font or All Open Fonts.</p>

<p>If you select a reference layer, it will also draw a skewed and rotated glyph in a separate layer, for you to use as a reference as you fix the curves. This is based on a script by <a href="http://www.occupant.org">Cyrus Highsmith</a>.</p>

<img src="https://github.com/FontBureau/fbOpenTools/raw/master/OverlayUFOs/OverlayUFOs_preview.png" />
 
<p>In the Current Glyph window, this extension will present an overlay of any glyph behind or beside what you are drawing. You can overlay glyphs from the Current Font or from any UFO.</p>

<p>This does NOT import any data into the background layer. Instead, it renders a outline directly from the source UFO into the glyph window view.</p>

<p>I use this to compare different glyphs within a font, look at a glyph across different styles, or to check for consistency within a family.</p>

<ul>

<li>There is no need to import duplicate data into a background layer.</li>

<li>The source outline is always live; when changes are made to the source, they will automatically appear in the current without re-importing.</li>

<li>You can add source fonts that are not open in the Robofont UI.</li>


</ul>
    
<p>A floating dialog is present to let you select and open source fonts, specify which glyph(s) to display, and select view options such as fill, stroke, color.</p>

<h3>Font selection</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Selecting Source Fonts</strong>: By default, the font list contains all currently opened fonts. Click on an individual font in the list to toggle its visibility in the overlay.</li>

<li><strong>Adding Other Fonts</strong>: You can manually add fonts by pressing the "+" button and selecting a UFO file. To save time and reduce clutter, the UFO will open without a Robofont interface.</li>

<li><strong>Reset Font List</strong>: The reset button will return the font selection to the default of all open fonts.</li>


</ul>

<h3>Glyph selection</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Overlay</strong>: By default, the extension will overlay all glyphs with the same name as the Current Glyph. If you wish to change this, type any single character or glyph name preceded by a slash in the center text field (just as you would type it in Space Center).</li>

<li><strong>Contexts</strong>: Using the Left Context and Right Context fields, you can also make glyphs appear on either side of your Current Glyph. These fields will accept one or more characters or glyph names preceded by a slash (just as you would type it in Space Center). Note: the spacing of the contexts currently does not account for kerning.<br /><br /></li>

</ul>

<p>An screenshot showing contexts in use:</p>

<img src="https://github.com/FontBureau/fbOpenTools/raw/master/OverlayUFOs/OverlayUFOs_preview.02.png" />



<h3>Other View Options</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Show</strong>: A quick way to enable/disable all overlays without closing the extension.</li>

<li><strong>Always View Current</strong>: When this option is checked, the extension will always overlay the Current Font, regardless of whether it is selected in the font list. This is useful if you switch fonts often, and always want to see contexts from the font you are editing.</li>

<li><strong>Fill</strong>: Overlay glyphs filled with the selected color.</li>

<li><strong>Stroke</strong>: Overlay glyphs showing only their outlines in the selected color.</li>

<li><strong>Alignment</strong>: Choose how the overlays are aligned to the Current Glyph.</li>

</ul>

<p>WARNING: THIS IS A BETA VERSION. This extension is still very much in development, and is a little rough around the edges. Your comments are welcome, and your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>This tool provides a commenting interface for Robofont. The comments are stored in each glyph’s lib.</p>

<p>Double clicking anywhere in the glyph window will load a comment dialog (shift+S). You can pick a symbol and/or type a text-based comment. There are some arrows and emoji faces, but U+1F4A9 is not an option (let’s keep our comments civil, people.) Use the right arrow to save the comment (I can’t figure out how to bind the Enter key). Once created, comments can be dragged in the glyph window. Double-click on a comment’s icon to edit or remove it.</p>

<p>A log of all comments for a font can be viewed in the Commentary window. Use the refresh button to load the most recent comments (still trying to figure out how to make it automatically refresh).</p>

<p>When reviewing comments, simply click on any comment in the Commentary window and your Current Glyph Window will be transported to that glyph and that comment will be highlighted. Marking a comment done will change its color from red to blue.</p>

<p>By default, Comment will change the Current Glyph Window’s view settings. Use the eyeballs button in the commentary window to toggle the view. The view settings will return to normal when the comment window is deactivated.</p>

<h3>Quick Comment Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>

<ul>
<li>shift+W: ↑</li>
<li>shift+X: ↓</li>
<li>shift+A: ←</li>
<li>shift+D: →</li>
<li>shift+Q: ↖</li>
<li>shift+E: ↗</li>
<li>shift+Z: ↙</li>
<li>shift+C: ↘</li>
<li>shift+S: 💬</li>
<li>shift+1: ━</li>
<li>shift+2: ╋</li>
</ul>


<h3>To do</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fix error where comments get shifted from one glyph to another from Commentary Window</li>
<li>Automatically refresh commentary window</li>
<li>Show/hide/delete comments marked as "done"</li>
<li>Font-level comments</li>
<li>Add CSV comment import/export</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This extension has been superceded by Nina Stössinger’s excellent <a href="https://github.com/ninastoessinger/word-o-mat">word-o-mat</a> extension, which does everything this does and more. I would recommend using that instead.</strong></p>

<img src="https://raw.github.com/FontBureau/fbOpenTools/master/RandomWordGenerator/randomWordGenerator_preview.png" />

<p>This extension sticks a string of random words into your current space center. The computer sometimes has a sick mind, so don’t blame me for offensive words! If a space center is not open, it will simply print the random words into the output window.</p>

<p>A small UI is provided that allows you to increase or decrease word count, and change the case. There is also a way to omit glyphs that do not exist in the font.</p>

<p>Since this only acts on the Current Space Center, you have to manually adjust something to set the words in multiple space centers.</p>

<p>Future improvements could include support for multiple languages (though this is English and I still don’t understand three quarters of the words). And Nick suggested a function that selects words based on the existing glyphs, as opposed to just omitting them.</p>

Takes all open fonts that have been skewed from the baseline, and offsets them by the Italic Slant Offset value accessible in Font Info > RoboFont. Offsets contours, anchors, guides, and the image for foreground layer and all other layers.

<img src="https://raw.github.com/FontBureau/fbOpenTools/master/ShowCharacterInfo/ShowCharacterInfo_preview.png" width="500" />

<p>In the current glyph window, this extension will unobtrusively display a readout of the unicode character represented by the current glyph, its hex unicode value(s), and the unicode name.</p>

<p>This is especially handy to reference when you are working with hard-to-use glyph names, unfamiliar characters, or alternate glyphs that do not contain unicode values.</p>

<p>If no unicodes are assigned to a glyph, the extension guesses the character(s) it represents by examines the glyph’s base name. It is not perfect, but should be able to approximate character information by interpreting uniXXXX/uXXXXX glyph names and by looking in the Adobe Glyph List. Approximated unicode values are marked with a tilde (~).</p>

<p>The extension will also analyze the glyph name’s suffix and display feature information, such as Small Caps and Stylistic Alternates.</p>

<p>If multiple values are assigned, all values will be shown along with the primary character name. If a glyph represents multiple characters (a ligature, for example), the character string will reflect that.</p>

<p>Installing this extension will activate it; it doesn’t appear in menus.</p>

<p>This is inspired by Frederik’s demo extension, <a href="http://doc.robofont.com/api/custom-observers/">DrawReferenceGlyph</a>.</p>

<p><strong>This extension has been superceded by <a href="https://github.com/FontBureau/fbOpenTools/tree/master/ShowMouseCoordinates">Show Mouse Coordinates</a>, which is better.</strong></p>

<img src="https://raw.github.com/FontBureau/fbOpenTools/master/ShowDelta/showDelta_preview.png" />

<p>In the current glyph window, this extension will provide a readout of the how far your mouse has been dragged. Installing it will activate it; it doesn’t appear in menus.</p>

<p>Theoretically it should work alongside any tool: edit, pen, knife, measure, etc. For some reason I have been getting weird results with the Shape Tool though.</p>

<p>I am open to suggestions on where to position the readout so it is least disruptive. I was thinking about putting it in the top left corner of the window, but I’m not not sure how to position something relative to the window instead of the glyph origin.</p>

<img src="https://raw.github.com/FontBureau/fbOpenTools/master/ShowMouseCoordinates/showMouseCoordinates_preview.png" />

<p>In the current glyph window, this extension will provide a readout of information about the mouse: its current position, how far it has been dragged, the dragging angle, and the dragging distance. The readout is positioned at the bottom left corner of the glyph window (thanks to Frederik Berlaen for his help figuring this out!).</p>

### Future improvements?

- Adjust readout position when window is resized.
- Remove display when in preview mode.
- Add info relative to a given reference point? Perhaps it could look for an anchor called "reference" and use that?
- Detect when rulers are on? Not worth the trouble, I’m guessing.
