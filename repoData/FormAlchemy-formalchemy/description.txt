FormAlchemy eliminates boilerplate by autogenerating HTML input fields from a
given model. FormAlchemy will try to figure out what kind of HTML code should
be returned by introspecting the model's properties and generate ready-to-use
HTML code that will fit the developer's application.

Of course, FormAlchemy can't figure out everything, i.e, the developer might
want to display only a few columns from the given model. Thus, FormAlchemy is
also highly customizable.
