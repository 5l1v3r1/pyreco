
## 3.0.0a2

* 

## 3.0.0a1

* Refactored the Manager into Node, LinkConfig, AudioInterface and Logger classes
* Refactored logging to use Python's logging framework
* Removed audio level feedback on the command line
* Moved configuration into objects for shared and node-specific (audio interface) values
* Removed PulseAudio element support (except through the 'auto' interface type)
* Removed variable size input queue, since this was an attempt to fix the audiorate related glitches but made no difference
* Removed CELT support; only Opus is now supported for compressed audio
* Removed colorama dependency
* Enabled support for disabling automatic connection under JACK (Chris Roberts)
* Added support for asking the audio interface for a sample rate (Chris Roberts)

## 2.3.6

* Fixed level messages reporting incorrect channel counts

## 2.3.5

* Added multicast support (Jonty Sewell)
* Added automatic audio interface selection support (Jonty Sewell)

## 2.3.4

* Minor bugfix

## 2.3.3

* Added support for Opus features:

    * Discontinuous transmission
    * In-band Forward Error Correction (and loss % assumption)
    * Frame size selection

## <2.3.3

* Check the git changelog for these changes.
# OpenOB
 [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/OpenOB.png)](http://badge.fury.io/py/OpenOB)

*There is now a mailing list available for [OpenOB users](http://lists.talkunafraid.co.uk/listinfo/openob-users) to share experiences and discuss future development.*

OpenOB (Open Outside Broadcast) is a simple Python/GStreamer based application which implements a highly configurable RTP-based audio link system.

It is primarily designed for broadcast applications including (but not limited to) contribution links, emission links, talkback, and intranet audio distribution systems.

## Features

* IETF standard Opus codec - variable bandwidth and bitrate, 16-384kbps
* Linear PCM mode for transparent audio transit over 1600kbps capable connections (LANs, fast wifi)
* Trivial configuration and setup via command line
* Transmitter-configured receivers for standalone receiver operation and control
* Low latency performance (codec internal latency under 5ms PCM, under 25ms Opus) with variable jitter buffer (0-150ms)
* System latency in low hundreds to tens of milliseconds for most applications; more over the internet/lossy links
* Automatic link recovery in the event of failures

## Licensing and Credits

OpenOB was developed by James Harrison, with chunks of example code used from Alexandre Bourget and various other GStreamer documentation sites such as the PyGST manual.
