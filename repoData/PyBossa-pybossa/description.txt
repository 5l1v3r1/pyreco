PyBossa is an open source platform for crowd-sourcing online (volunteer)
assistance to perform tasks that require human cognition, knowledge or
intelligence (e.g. image classification, transcription, information location
etc). 

![Shuttleworth Foundation Funded](http://pybossa.com/assets/img/shuttleworth-funded.png)

PyBossa was inspired by the [BOSSA](http://bossa.berkeley.edu/) crowdsourcing engine but is written in
python (hence the name!). It can be used for any distributed tasks application
but was initially developed to help scientists and other researchers
crowd-source human problem-solving skills!

# See it in Action

PyBossa powers [CrowdCrafting.org](http://crowdcrafting.org/) and [ForestWatchers.net](http://forestwatchers.net)

# Installing and Upgrading

**Important: if you are updating a server, please, be sure to check the
Database Migration scripts, as new changes could introduce new tables,
columns, etc, in the DB model. See the [Migration Section](http://docs.pybossa.com/en/latest/install.html#migrating-the-database-table-structure) from the
documentation**

See [installation instructions](http://docs.pybossa.com/en/latest/install.html).

**NOTE**: The latest version uses M2CRYPTO and the pypi version has a bug that
does not allow you to sign properly RSA keys. Keep sure to use this other
version (pinned in requirements.txt):
`pip install -e git+https://github.com/Hypernode/M2Crypto#egg=M2Crypto`
