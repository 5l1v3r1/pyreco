Example scripts that we run on the ScrumDo.com web server on a periodic basis.

Our crontab looks something like this:

10 22 * * * scrumdo/cron-scripts/record_backlog.sh
11 22 * * * scrumdo/cron-scripts/site_stats.sh
*/2 * * * * scrumdo/cron-scripts/send_email.sh
1 1 * * * scrumdo/cron-scripts/resend_email.sh
*/5 * * * * scrumdo/cron-scripts/extras_sync.sh
2 1 * * * scrumdo/cron-scripts/extras_pull.sh

Building documentation
======================

To build the documentation (from root of source tree)::

    cd docs/
    bash build_docs.sh

This will create ``external/repos`` where it will checkout external
repositories. It will create symlinks in ``external/`` pointing to the docs
directories. This allows Sphinx to properly reference external documentation.

Running ``build_docs.sh`` more than once is okay. It cleans up any previous
runs.

@@@ Don't do full checkouts on each run of ``build_docs.sh``.


Building documentation on pinaxproject.com
==========================================

This section only applies to individuals wanting to build documentation on
pinaxproject.com. To build the documentation (assuming working directory is
``/home/pinax``)::

    cd docs_build/pinax-master
    git pull
    cd docs/
    bash build_docs.sh

While ``build_docs.sh`` is running the online documentation goes down. Ideally
we build in support to show a page indicating the rebuild while running.

Pinax: a platform for rapidly developing websites
http://pinaxproject.com/

Pinax is an MIT-licensed, open-source platform built on the Django Web
Framework.

By integrating numerous reusable Django apps to take care of the things
that many sites have in common, it let's you focus on what makes your
site different.

While our initial development was focused around a demo social
networking site, Pinax is suitable for a wide variety of websites. We
are working on number of editions tailored to intranets, event
management, learning management, software project management and more.

Most discussion about Pinax takes place on the IRC channel #pinax on
Freenode or the pinax-users mailing list on Google Groups.

  _installer.py. Add installers/<version>.py to create version specific
  bootstrap scripts pinax-boot-<version>.py

_installer.py
  Contains the installation mechanism for boostrapping the development version.

  Is a full virtualenv.py and includes _installer.py, will install release
  version, full release versions and developer versions.

downloader.py
  Parses the requirements in requirements/external_apps.txt and downloads the
  source distribution of the packages mentioned, if possible. Will return a
  list of other distributions that are only available as source code and
  should be packaged up manually and moved to download/.
