# terminal-notifier

terminal-notifier is a command-line tool to send Mac OS X User Notifications,
which are available in Mac OS X 10.8 and higher.


## Caveats

* The Notification Center _always_ uses the applicationâ€™s own icon, thereâ€™s
  currently no way to specify a custom icon for a notification. The only way to
  use this tool with your own icon is to use the `-sender` option or include a
  build of terminal-notifier with your icon and bundle identifier instead.

  However, you _can_ use unicode symbols and emojis. See the examples.

* It is currently packaged as an application bundle, because `NSUserNotification`
  does not work from a â€˜Foundation toolâ€™. [radar://11956694](radar://11956694)


## Download

Prebuilt binaries are available from the
[releases section](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier/releases).

Or if you want to use this from
[Ruby](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier/tree/master/Ruby), you can
install it through RubyGems:

```
$ [sudo] gem install terminal-notifier
```


## Usage

```
$ ./terminal-notifier.app/Contents/MacOS/terminal-notifier -[message|group|list] [VALUE|ID|ID] [options]
```

In order to use terminal-notifier, you have to call the binary _inside_ the
application bundle.

The Ruby gem, which wraps this tool, _does_ have a bin wrapper. If installed
you can simply do:

```
$ terminal-notifier -[message|group|list] [VALUE|ID|ID] [options]
```

This will obviously be a bit slower than using the tool without the wrapper.

Some examples are:

```
$ echo 'Piped Message Data!' | terminal-notifier -sound default
$ terminal-notifier -title 'ðŸ’°' -message 'Check your Apple stock!' -open 'http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AAPL'
$ terminal-notifier -group 'address-book-sync' -title 'Address Book Sync' -subtitle 'Finished' -message 'Imported 42 contacts.' -activate 'com.apple.AddressBook'
```


#### Options

At a minimum, you have to specify either the `-message` , the `-remove`
option or the `-list` option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-message VALUE`  **[required]**

The message body of the notification.

Note that if this option is omitted and data is piped to the application, that
data will be used instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-title VALUE`

The title of the notification. This defaults to â€˜Terminalâ€™.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-subtitle VALUE`

The subtitle of the notification.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-group ID`

Specifies the â€˜groupâ€™ a notification belongs to. For any â€˜groupâ€™ only _one_
notification will ever be shown, replacing previously posted notifications.

A notification can be explicitely removed with the `-remove` option, describe
below.

Examples are:

* The senderâ€™s name to scope the notifications by tool.
* The senderâ€™s process ID to scope the notifications by a unique process.
* The current working directory to scope notifications by project.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-remove ID`  **[required]**

Removes a notification that was previously sent with the specified â€˜groupâ€™ ID,
if one exists. If used with the special group "ALL", all message are removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-list ID` **[required]**

Lists details about the specified â€˜groupâ€™ ID. If used with the special group
"ALL", details about all currently active  messages are displayed.

The output of this command is tab-separated, which makes it easy to parse.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-activate ID`

Specifies which application should be activated when the user clicks the
notification.

You can find the bundle identifier of an application in its `Info.plist` file
_inside_ the application bundle.

Examples are:

* `com.apple.Terminal` to activate Terminal.app
* `com.apple.Safari` to activate Safari.app

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-sender ID`

Specifying this will make it appear as if the notification was send by that
application instead, including using its icon.

For information on the `ID` see the `-activate` option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-open URL`

Specifies a resource to be opened when the user clicks the notification. This
can be a web or file URL, or any custom URL scheme.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-execute COMMAND`

Specifies a shell command to run when the user clicks the notification.
