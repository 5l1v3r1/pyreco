krTheme Sphinx Style
====================

This repository contains sphinx styles Kenneth Reitz uses in most of
his projects. It is a derivative of Mitsuhiko's themes for Flask and Flask related
projects.  To use this style in your Sphinx documentation, follow
this guide:

1. put this folder as _themes into your docs folder. Alternatively
   you can also use git submodules to check out the contents there.

2. add this to your conf.py:

    sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('_themes'))
    html_theme_path = ['_themes']
    html_theme = 'kr'

The following themes exist:

**kr**
    the standard flask documentation theme for large projects

**kr_small**
    small one-page theme.  Intended to be used by very small addon libraries.


**particle**: _track article promotion_
========

**NOTE**: `particle` is no longer supported.  All functionality will be replaced and enhanced by [newslynx.org](http://www.newslynx.org)


`particle` is a tool for collecting data about the promotion of articles on Twitter, Facebook, Webpages, and RSS feeds (for now). It automatically joins this data together by a common url and bucketed timestamp.  This enables analysis similar to that which I discuss in this [blog post](http://brianabelson.com/open-news/2013/11/14/Pageviews-above-replacement.html). `particle` is the ideal companion to [`pollster`](https://github.com/stdbrouw/pollster), which tracks the performance of links on social media.
