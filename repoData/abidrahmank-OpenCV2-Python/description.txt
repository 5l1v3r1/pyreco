Hi,

This is the code for visual sudoku solver. It is still under development although it works fine for the given image in the folder. 

I haven't tested it for other images.

Run the "sudoku.py" file in this folder. If you want to try for other images, change code accordingly.

Explanations for first few portions of code can be found in my blog : www.opencvpython.blogspot.com

This repo contains some samples codes on OpenCV-Python with new 'cv2' interface.

It contains two folders:
1) Official_Tutorial_Python_version : It contains the corresponding Python codes for C++ codes in official tutorials. So explanation of the code can be found at 'http://opencv.itseez.com/doc/tutorials/tutorials.html' 

2) Blog_codes : It contains some codes which I have explained in my blog 'www.opencvpython.blogspot.com'. For explanation, visit the blog.
