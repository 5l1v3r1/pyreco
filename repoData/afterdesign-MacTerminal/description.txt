1. Added Debug mode.
    When plugin is not working correctly you can turn on debug mode with ```'debug': true``` in settings.
    After that please use again plugin and send me log from sublime console (default shortcut is ``` ctrl+` ```).
    Just copy text between "---MacTerminal Debug Start---" and "---MacTerminal Debug End---" and paste it to issue.

2. Updated Terminal applescript.
    I found that Terminal can have problems with speed between commands so I've added small delays.
    Looks like it does the trick.

3. Updated links in packages.json to codeload.github.com

4. Added tags and updated packages.json to download code from tag.

5. Updated readmes.

Added option to define ``` osascript ``` path because some of you may have problem with PATHs.
From now by path to ``` osascript ``` it's set to ``` /usr/bin/osascript ``` and can be changed in settings.
More info in [issue #8](https://github.com/afterdesign/MacTerminal/issues/8).

For more info how to setup ``` osascript ``` path just checkout [README.md](https://github.com/afterdesign/MacTerminal)

Added "Open in terminal" to command palette.

Thanx to ap0 (https://github.com/ap0) there is default_path to fallback if there is a problem with file path.

There is also some interesting information from Thomas Noe
about possible issue for people using dropbox for project syncing:

# Terminal plugin for sublime

1. Fully packaged
2. Currently with option to open new tab on OS X (works fine on 10.8)
3. Sublime Text 3 beta support

# How to install ?
### From git:
```
cd $PATH_OF_SUBLIME_PACKAGES
git clone git://github.com/afterdesign/MacTerminal.git
```

### From [package control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)
Just type MacTerminal

# FAQ
1. How do I use this ?

    Just use "ctrl+command+t" while editing file to open terminal with cd to directory where the file exists.

    You can also use the "Open in terminal" option in sidebar.

2. How can I change shortcut ?

    Go to:

    ```
    Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences     -> Package Settings -> Macterminal -> Key Bindings - User
    ```
    and add something like:

    ```
    { "keys": ["super+t"], "command": "open_mac_terminal" }
    ```

3. The "Open in terminal" is greyed out.
    This happens when there is no opened file and for now I don't know if
    this is just a sublime bug or I need to change something.
        For now I saw the same behavior in

4. How to I use it with iTerm 2 ?
    Simply go to:

    ```
    Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Package Settings -> Macterminal -> Settings - User
    ```

    and add:

    ```
    {
        "terminal"   :  "iterm"
    }
    ```

    If you wish you can also change it in Settings - Default.

5. How do I change path to ``` osascript ``` ?

    To check what is path for ``` osascript ``` just open terminal and type:

    ```
    which osascript
    ```

    With path simply go to:

    ```
    Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Package Settings -> Macterminal -> Settings - User
    ```

    and add:

    ```
    {
        "osascript"   :  "/usr/bin/osascript"
    }
    ```

6. Can I always open main directory of project ?

    From version 2.0 you can.

    Open:
    ```
    Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Package Settings -> Macterminal -> Settings - User
    ```

    And set :
    ```
    {
        "directory_mode" : "project"
    }
    ```

    From now on if you have only 1 directory added to project it's going to be opened by default.
    If you have more than 1 directory in your project you'll see quickpanel to select what you would like to open.

    Thanks [@dirajkumar](https://github.com/dirajkumar) for the idea !

7. Its not working for me.

    First of all enable ```debug``` mode. To do this open your settings and add:
    ``` "debug": true ```

    After this try to open terminal again. If it's not working (and debug shouldn't repair the problem)
    open sublime console (default shortcut is ``` ctrl+` ```) and open new issue with log
    between ```---MacTerminal Debug Start---``` and ```---MacTerminal Debug End---```.
