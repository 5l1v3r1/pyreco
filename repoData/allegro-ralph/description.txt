How To Install
==============

Install in Sphinx
-----------------

Copy this directory into the ``sphinx/templates`` directory where Shpinx is installed. For example, a standard install of sphinx on Mac OS X is at ``/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/Sphinx-0.6.3-py2.6.egg/``

Install Somewhere Else
----------------------

If you want to install this theme somewhere else, you will have to modify the ``conf.py`` file. ::

    templates_path = ['/absolute/path/to/dir/','relative/path/']

Install Directly in Your Documentation
--------------------------------------

If you want to include the files directly in the documentation, so another person can build your documentation, it is easy.

 1. Copy over everything in the ``static`` directory into the ``_static`` directory of your documentation's source folder.

 2. Copy the ``layout.html`` file into the ``_templates`` directory of your documentation's source folder.

 3. Alter your ``conf.py`` ::

        html_theme = 'basic'

    instead of ``'ADCtheme'``.


Making Sphinx Use the Theme
---------------------------

If you aren't installing the files directly into your documentation, edit the ``conf.py`` file and make the following setting: ::

    html_theme = 'ADCtheme'
