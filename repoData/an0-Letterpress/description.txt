# python-markdown2 Changelog

## python-markdown2 2.1.1 (not yet released)

(nothing yet)


## python-markdown2 2.1.0

- ["nofollow" extra, issue #74, pull #104] Add `rel="nofollow"` support
  (mostly by https://github.com/cdman):

        $ echo '[link](http://example)' | markdown2 -x nofollow
        <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://example">link</a></p>

   Limitation: This *can* add a duplicate 'rel' attribute to raw HTML links
   in the input.

## python-markdown2 2.0.1

- ["toc" extra] Unescape Markdown special chars in TOC entries. See
  <https://github.com/trentm/restdown/issues/15>.

- Now 'tox' testing support (by github.com/msabramo):

        [sudo] pip install tox
        tox

  confirming that markdown2 works with jython (not sure which version) and
  pypy!  Also added pypy to travis-ci testing
  (http://travis-ci.org/#!/trentm/python-markdown2).


## python-markdown2 2.0.0

- [issue #90] Add a `Markdown.preprocess(text) -> text` hook for subclasses.
  This is a match for the `Markdown.postprocess(text) -> text` hook added in
  an earlier version. (by @joestump).

- [issue #90, backward incompatible change] Require a space between the '#'
  and a text for a title. I.e.:

        # This still works

        #This doesn't work

        ##Nor this

  This keeps comments, hash tags, and ticket numbers at the beginning of the
  line from turning into an h1. (by @joestump)

  This is a backward incompatible change, however small, hence the version
  change to 2.0.0.


## python-markdown2 1.4.2

- [issue #84, issue #87] Fix problems with fenced-code-blocks getting
  double-processed.


## python-markdown2 1.4.1

- [issue #67] Fix an sub-`ul` inside a `ol` not working with an indent less
  than 4 spaces.

- Fix code blocks and fenced-code-blocks to work with a single leading newline
  at the start of the input.

- [issue #86, 'fenced-code-blocks' extra] Fix fenced code blocks not being
  parsed out before other syntax elements, like headers.

- [issue #83, 'fenced-code-blocks' and 'code-color' extras] Allow 'cssclass'
  code coloring option (passed to pygments) to be overridden (by
  https://github.com/kaishaku). E.g.:

        import markdown2
        html = markdown2.markdown(text,
            extras={'fenced-code-blocks': {'cssclass': 'mycode'}})


## python-markdown2 1.4.0

- [issue #64] Python 3 support! markdown2.py supports Python 2 and 3 in the
  same file without requiring install-time 2to3 transformation.


## python-markdown2 1.3.1

- [issue #80] Jython 2.2.1 support fix (by github.com/clach04)


## python-markdown2 1.3.0

- Deprecate `code-color` extra. Use the `fenced-code-block` extra and
  its cleaner mechanism for specifying the language, instead. This extra
  will be removed in v2.0 or so.

- New `fenced-code-blocks` extra. It allows a code block to not have to be
  indented by fencing it with '```' on a line before and after. Based on
  [GFM](<http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).

        Some code:

        ```
        print "hi"
        ```

  It includes support for code syntax highlighting as per GFM. This requires
  the `pygments` Python module to be on the pythonpath.

        ```python
        if True:
            print "hi"
        ```


## python-markdown2 1.2.0

- [issue #78, issue #77] Add "metadata" extra (github.com/slomo).


## python-markdown2 1.1.1

- Drop "Makefile.py" (a `mk` thing) and simplify to "Makefile".


## python-markdown2 1.1.0

- [issue #76] Ensure "smarty-pants" extra doesn't destroy image links
  and links with title text.

- [issue #72] Support reading from stdin for command line tool like any
  well-behaved unix tool, e.g.:

      $ echo '*hi*' | markdown2
      <p><em>hi</em></p>

  Thanks Ryan!

- Drop this "1.0.1.*" version silliness. The idea *was* that the first three
  numbers tracked the Markdown.pl on which markdown2.py was originally based.
  I don't believe Markdown.pl really gets releases anymore tho, so pointless.


## python-markdown2 1.0.1.19

- [Issue 66] Add "wiki-tables" extra for Google Code Wiki-style tables.
  See <http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax#Tables>.


## python-markdown2 1.0.1.18

- [Issue 57] Add html5 block tags (article, section, aside, et al; see
  "_html5tags" variable) to Markdown literal HTML block tag handling. Thanks
  Tim Gray!

- [Issue 56] Fix `setup.py install`.

- [Issue 54] Fix escaping of link title attributes. Thanks FND!

- Tweak list matching to NOT make a ul for something like this:

        - - - - - hi there

  Before this change this would be a silly 5-deep nested li. See
  "not_quite_a_list" test case.

- [Issue 52] Fix potential pathologically slow matching for `<hr>` markdown
  ("slow_hr" test case).

- Add a `Markdown.postprocess(text) -> text` hook that is called near the end
  of markdown conversion. By default this does no transformation. It is called
  just before unescaping of special characters and unhashing of literal HTML
  blocks.

- ["header-ids" and "toc" extras] Add "n" argument to
  `Markdown.header_id_from_text` hook. This allows a subclass using this hook
  to differentiate the header id based on the hN number (e.g. h1 diff that
  h2). Also allow a `None` return value to not add an id to that header (and
  exclude that header from the TOC).

  Note: If you used this hook, this is an incompatible change to the call
  signature.

- Add a "markdown-in-html" extra similar to (but limited)
  <http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/#markdown-attr>. I.e. this:

        <div markdown="1">
        Yo **yo**!
        </div>

  becomes:

        <div>

        Yo <strong>yo</strong>!

        </div>

- [Issue 39] Test case fix for pygments 1.3.1 from thomas.moschny.

- [Issue 42] Add "smarty-pants" extra for transforming plain ASCII
  punctuation characters into smart typographic punctuation HTML entities.
  Inspiration: <http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/>
  Implementation by Nikhil Chelliah. Also add `\'` and `\"` escape sequences
  for forcing dumb quotes when this extra is in use.

- Guard against using `True` instead of `None` as follows
  `markdown(..., extras={'header-ids': True})`. `None` is wanted, but `True`
  is commonly (at least I did it twice) used.


## python-markdown2 1.0.1.17

- [Issue 36] Fix "cuddled-lists" extra handling for an
  looks-like-a-cuddled-list-but-is-indented block. See the
  "test/tm-cases/cuddled_list_indented.text" test case.

- Experimental new "toc" extra. The returned string from conversion will have
  a `toc_html` attribute.

- New "header-ids" extra that will add an `id` attribute to headers:

        # My First Section

  will become:

        <h1 id="my-first-section">My First Section</h1>

  An argument can be give for the extra, which will be used as a prefix for
  the ids:

        $ cat foo.txt
        # hi there
        $ python markdown2.py foo.txt
        <h1>hi there</h1>
        $ python markdown2.py foo.txt -x header-ids
        <h1 id="hi-there">hi there</h1>
        $ python markdown2.py foo.txt -x header-ids=prefix
        <h1 id="prefix-hi-there">hi there</h1>

- Preliminary support for "html-classes" extra: takes a dict mapping HTML tag
  to the string value to use for a "class" attribute for that emitted tag.
  Currently just supports "pre" and "code" for code *blocks*.


## python-markdown2 1.0.1.16

- [Issue 33] Implement a "cuddled-lists" extra that allows:

        I did these things:
        * bullet1
        * bullet2
        * bullet3

  to be converted to:

        <p>I did these things:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>bullet1</li>
        <li>bullet2</li>
        <li>bullet3</li>
        </ul>


## python-markdown2 1.0.1.15

- [Issue 30] Fix a possible XSS via JavaScript injection in a carefully
  crafted image reference (usage of double-quotes in the URL).

## python-markdown2 1.0.1.14

- [Issue 29] Fix security hole in the md5-hashing scheme for handling HTML
  chunks during processing.
- [Issue 27] Fix problem with underscores in footnotes content (with
  "footnotes" extra).

## python-markdown2 1.0.1.13

- [Issue 24] Set really long sentinel for max-length of link text to avoid
  problems with reasonably long ones.
- [Issue 26] Complete the fix for this issue. Before this change the
  randomized obscuring of 'mailto:' link letters would sometimes result
  in emails with underscores getting misinterpreted as for italics.

## python-markdown2 1.0.1.12

- [Issue 26] Fix bug where email auto linking wouldn't work for emails with
  underscores. E.g. `Mail me: <foo_bar@example.com>` wouldn't work.
- Update MANIFEST.in to ensure bin/markdown2 gets included in sdist.
- [Issue 23] Add support for passing options to pygments for the "code-color"
  extra. For example:

        >>> markdown("...", extras={'code-color': {"noclasses": True}})

  This `formatter_opts` dict is passed to the pygments HtmlCodeFormatter.
  Patch from 'svetlyak.40wt'.
- [Issue 21] Escape naked '>' characters, as is already done for '&' and '<'
  characters. Note that other markdown implementations (both Perl and PHP) do
  *not* do this. This results in differing output with two 3rd-party tests:
  "php-markdown-cases/Backslash escapes.text" and "markdowntest-cases/Amps
  and angle encoding.tags".
- "link-patterns" extra: Add support for the href replacement being a
  callable, e.g.:

        >>> link_patterns = [
        ...     (re.compile("PEP\s+(\d+)", re.I),
        ...      lambda m: "http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-%04d/" % int(m.group(1))),
        ... ]
        >>> markdown2.markdown("Here is PEP 42.", extras=["link-patterns"],
        ...     link_patterns=link_patterns)
        u'<p>Here is <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0042/">PEP 42</a>.</p>\n'

## python-markdown2 1.0.1.11

- Fix syntax_color test for the latest Pygments.
- [Issue 20] Can't assume that `sys.argv` is defined at top-level code --
  e.g. when used at a PostreSQL stored procedure. Fix that.

## python-markdown2 1.0.1.10

- Fix sys.path manipulation in setup.py so `easy_install markdown2-*.tar.gz`
  works. (Henry Precheur pointed out the problem.)
- "bin/markdown2" is now a stub runner script rather than a symlink to
  "lib/markdown2.py". The symlink was a problem for sdist: tar makes it a
  copy.
- Added 'xml' extra: passes *one-liner* XML processing instructions and
  namespaced XML tags without wrapping in a `<p>` -- i.e. treats them as a HTML
  block tag.

## python-markdown2 1.0.1.9

- Fix bug in processing text with two HTML comments, where the first comment
  is cuddled to other content. See "test/tm-cases/two_comments.text". Noted
  by Wolfgang Machert.
- Revert change in v1.0.1.6 passing XML processing instructions and one-liner
  tags. This changed caused some bugs. Similar XML processing support will
  make it back via an "xml" extra.

## python-markdown2 1.0.1.8

- License note updates to facilitate Thomas Moschny building a package for
  Fedora Core Linux. No functional change.

## python-markdown2 1.0.1.7

- Add a proper setup.py and release to pypi:
  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/markdown2/
- Move markdown2.py module to a lib subdir. This allows one to put the "lib"
  dir of a source checkout (e.g. via an svn:externals) on ones Python Path
  without have the .py files at the top-level getting in the way.

## python-markdown2 1.0.1.6

- Fix Python 2.6 deprecation warning about the `md5` module.
- Pass XML processing instructions and one-liner tags. For example:

        <?blah ...?>
        <xi:include xmlns:xi="..." />

  Limitations: they must be on one line. Test: pi_and_xinclude.
  Suggested by Wolfgang Machert.

## python-markdown2 1.0.1.5

- Add ability for 'extras' to have arguments. Internally the 'extras'
  attribute of the Markdown class is a dict (it was a set).
- Add "demote-headers" extra that will demote the markdown for, e.g., an h1
  to h2-6 by the number of the demote-headers argument.

        >>> markdown('# this would be an h1', extras={'demote-headers': 2})
        u'<h3>this would be an h1</h3>\n'

  This can be useful for user-supplied Markdown content for a sub-section of
  a page.

## python-markdown2 1.0.1.4

- [Issue 18] Allow spaces in the URL for link definitions.
- [Issue 15] Fix some edge cases with backslash-escapes.
- Fix this error that broken command-line usage:

        NameError: global name 'use_file_vars' is not defined

- Add "pyshell" extra for auto-codeblock'ing Python interactive shell
  sessions even if they weren't properly indented by the tab width.

## python-markdown2 1.0.1.3

- Make the use of the `-*- markdown-extras: ... -*-` emacs-style files
  variable to set "extras" **off** be default. It can be turned on via
  `--use-file-vars` on the command line and `use_file_vars=True` via the
  module interface.
- [Issue 3] Drop the code-color extra hack added *for* issue3 that was
  causing the a unicode error with unicode in a code-colored block,
  <http://code.google.com/p/python-markdown2/issues/detail?id=3#c8>

## python-markdown2 1.0.1.2

- [Issue 8] Alleviate some of the incompat of the last change by allowing (at
  the Python module level) the usage of `safe_mode=True` to mean what it used
  to -- i.e. "replace" safe mode.
- [Issue 8, **incompatible change**] The "-s|--safe" command line option and
  the equivalent "safe_mode" option has changed semantics to be a string
  instead of a boolean. Legal values of the string are "replace" (the old
  behaviour: literal HTML is replaced with "[HTML_REMOVED]") and "escape"
  (meta chars in literal HTML is escaped).
- [Issue 11] Process markup in footnote definition bodies.
- Add support for `-*- markdown-extras: ... -*-` emacs-style files variables
  (typically in an XML comment) to set "extras" for the markdown conversion.
- [Issue 6] Fix problem with footnotes if the reference string had uppercase
  letters.

## python-markdown2 1.0.1.1

- [Issue 3] Fix conversion of unicode strings.
- Make the "safe_mode" replacement test overridable via subclassing: change
  `Markdown.html_removed_text`.
- [Issue 2] Fix problems with "safe_mode" removing generated HTML, instead of
  just raw HTML in the text.
- Add "-s|--safe" command-line option to set "safe_mode" conversion
  boolean. This option is mainly for compat with markdown.py.
- Add "link-patterns" extra: allows one to specify a list of regexes that
  should be automatically made into links. For example, one can define a
  mapping for things like "Mozilla Bug 1234":

        regex:  mozilla\s+bug\s+(\d+)
        href:   http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=\1

  See <https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/Extras> for details.
- Add a "MarkdownWithExtras" class that enables all extras (except
  "code-friendly"):

        >>> import markdown2
        >>> converter = markdown2.MarkdownWithExtras()
        >>> converter.convert('...TEXT...')
        ...HTML...

- [Issue 1] Added "code-color" extra: pygments-based (TODO: link) syntax
  coloring of code blocks. Requires the pygments Python library on sys.path.
  See <https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/Extras> for details.
- [Issue 1] Added "footnotes" extra: adds support for footnotes syntax. See
  <https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/Extras> for details.

## python-markdown2 1.0.1.0

- Added "code-friendly" extra: disables the use of leading and trailing `_`
  and `__` for emphasis and strong. These can easily get in the way when
  writing docs about source code with variable_list_this and when one is not
  careful about quoting.
- Full basic Markdown syntax.


(Started maintaining this log 15 Oct 2007. At that point there had been no
releases of python-markdown2.)

# Test the perf of some Markdown implementations.

1. Generate some test cases:

        ./gen_perf_cases.py [limit]

   for example:

        ./gen_perf_cases.py 1000

   This created a bunch of (small) test .txt files in "cases". These are
   derived from a bunch of [Python Cookbook][] data. "limit" is a max number
   of "recipes" in the data set for which to generate cases.
   
   The test files are small and don't necessarily a lot of markup, so this
   may not really be a good *breadth* perf suite -- it *is* real data though.

2. Process the Markdown for each "cases/*.txt" with Markdown.pl, markdown.py
   and markdown2.py:

        ./perf.py


# TODO

- strip out the .text cases that markdown.py blows up on? (encoding problems)
- add some larger perf suites (perhaps those test case files that all
  Markdown implementations pass)
- add markdown.php timing

Markdown is a light text markup format and a processor to convert that to HTML.
The originator describes it as follows:

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.
> Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read,
> easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to
> structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).
>
> -- <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>

This (markdown2) is a fast and complete Python implementation of Markdown. It
was written to closely match the behaviour of the original Perl-implemented
Markdown.pl. Markdown2 also comes with a number of extensions (called
"extras") for things like syntax coloring, tables, header-ids. See the
"Extra Syntax" section below. "markdown2" supports all Python versions
from 2.4 to 3.3 (and pypy and jython, though I don't frequently test those).

There is another [Python
markdown.py](http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/). However, at
least at the time this project was started, markdown2.py was faster (see the
[Performance
Notes](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/Performance-Notes)) and,
to my knowledge, more correct (see [Testing
Notes](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/Testing-Notes)).
That was a while ago though, so you shouldn't discount Python-markdown from
your consideration.

Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=trentmick" target="_blank">@trentmick</a>
for updates to python-markdown2.

Travis-ci.org test status: [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/trentm/python-markdown2.png)](http://travis-ci.org/trentm/python-markdown2)


# Install

To install it in your Python installation run *one* of the following:

    pip install markdown2
    pypm install markdown2      # if you use ActivePython (activestate.com/activepython)
    easy_install markdown2      # if this is the best you have
    python setup.py install

However, everything you need to run this is in "lib/markdown2.py". If it is
easier for you, you can just copy that file to somewhere on your PythonPath
(to use as a module) or executable path (to use as a script).


# Quick Usage

As a module:

    >>> import markdown2
    >>> markdown2.markdown("*boo!*")  # or use `html = markdown_path(PATH)`
    u'<p><em>boo!</em></p>\n'

    >>> markdowner = Markdown()
    >>> markdowner.convert("*boo!*")
    u'<p><em>boo!</em></p>\n'
    >>> markdowner.convert("**boom!**")
    u'<p><strong>boom!</strong></p>\n'

As a script (CLI):

    $ python markdown2.py foo.md > foo.html

I think pip-based installation will enable this as well:

    $ markdown2 foo.md > foo.html

See the [project wiki](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki),
[lib/markdown2.py](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/blob/master/lib/markdown2.py)
docstrings and/or `python markdown2.py --help` for more details.


# Extra Syntax (aka extensions)

Many Markdown processors include support for additional optional syntax
(often called "extensions") and markdown2 is no exception. With markdown2 these
are called "extras".  Using the "footnotes" extra as an example, here is how
you use an extra ... as a module:

    $ python markdown2.py --extras footnotes foo.md > foo.html

as a script:

    >>> import markdown2
    >>> markdown2.markdown("*boo!*", extras=["footnotes"])
    u'<p><em>boo!</em></p>\n'

There are a number of currently implemented extras for tables, footnotes,
syntax coloring of `<pre>`-blocks, auto-linking patterns, table of contents,
Smarty Pants (for fancy quotes, dashes, etc.) and more. See the [Extras
wiki page](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/Extras) for full
details.


# Project

The python-markdown2 project lives at
<https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/>.  (Note: On Mar 6, 2011 this
project was moved from [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/python-markdown2)
to here on Github.) See also, [markdown2 on the Python Package Index
(PyPI)](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/markdown2).

The change log: <https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/blob/master/CHANGES.md>

To report a bug: <https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/issues>


# Test Suite

This markdown implementation passes a fairly extensive test suite. To run it:

    make test

The crux of the test suite is a number of "cases" directories -- each with a
set of matching .text (input) and .html (expected output) files. These are:

    tm-cases/                   Tests authored for python-markdown2 (tm=="Trent Mick")
    markdowntest-cases/         Tests from the 3rd-party MarkdownTest package
    php-markdown-cases/         Tests from the 3rd-party MDTest package
    php-markdown-extra-cases/   Tests also from MDTest package

See the [Testing Notes wiki
page](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/Testing-Notes) for full
details.

Mako is a templating language. I have some unfinished work here
to attempt to get markdown2.py to treat Mako syntax just like raw
HTML. I.e. allow writing mixed Markdown-Mako text.

The key here is *unfinished*. I'm not sure if it is reasonable or feasible
to support this with the current implementation.

title: Letterpress
date: 01/31/2013
excerpt: Letterpress is a minimal, Markdown based blogging system written in Python.
tags: math, web

*This is a sample post to demonstrate how to write a post in Letterpress. You can see the rendered result [here](http://wangling.me/2013/01/letterpress.html).*

### Updated on 02/21/2013

With the release of Letterpress 0.0.2 I can have fun with math easily. Simply attaching a “math” tag gains me the power of math: $E=m*c^2$.

I'm writing this post in [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com) on my iPad while cozily lying in my recliner after lunch. I'm writing it in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), not messy HTML. The first half was typed in on my MacBook Pro, also in iA Writer. I can publish it from my iPhone later by moving it to a special folder in my Dropbox when I'm out.

To make this whole writing and publishing experience possible, I built my own blogging system — [Letterpress](https://github.com/an0/Letterpress). 

I've been using [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) since July, 2009. It is almost good enough. I encountered several downtimes when MySQL hung. I don't know a thing about database so I had to reboot the whole machine. I even wrote 1 or 2 small WordPress plugins for my own use, which further consolidated my aversion to PHP. RSS/Atom feed generating is meaningless to me since I'm not famous and no one subscribe to my blog except myself. Comments are also just ego feeders and I guess I got more VIAGRA spams than sensible comments. Most importantly, the writing experience is not good, neither in its web editor nor in its mobile apps.

I just want a minimal blogging system with good writing experience. Only static text files, no dynamic HTML generated from database. No RSS/Atom. No comments. And no PHP.

That's how Letterpress was conceived and built. I believe you can guess how it is named.
# What's Letterpress?
Letterpress is a minimal, [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) based blogging system written in Python.

# Why Letterpress?
* Letterpress is lighter than WordPress.
* Python is prettier than PHP.
* Static/text is more reliable than dynamic/database.
* Markdown is more human-friendly than HTML.
* Math writing is much easier in ASCIIMathML than in MathML.

# Requirements
1. A Linux kernel with inotify support is required to run Letterpress.
2. Python 3 is assumed. I want to contribute to the acceleration of the transition from Python 2 to Python 3. I didn't test with Python 2.
3. [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org) and [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org) are recommended.
4. UTF-8 is assumed. The babel of human languages is bad enough, let's at least use the same encoding.

# Installation
1. Install [pyinotify](https://github.com/seb-m/pyinotify).
	```bash
	pip install pyinotify
	```
2. Copy `code/letterpress.py` to your Python runtime path. 
3. Copy `code/markdown2/lib/markdown2.py` to your Python runtime path.
4. Make a directory to hold your posts — let's call it *press_folder* — and copy `press/*` to it.
5. Make the necessary changes to the templates(title, twitter handle…) and `letterpress.config`.
6. Install [Pygments](http://pygments.org) if you want to embed code(using [GFM](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/)'s Syntax Highlighting) in your posts.
	```bash
	pip install Pygments
	```

# Usage
```bash
$ python letterpress.py path_to_press_folder
```

# How It Works
After launch, Letterpress monitors Markdown files(recognized by the filename extension specified in `letterpress.config`) in *press_folder*. When an new Markdown file is detected Letterpress generates a new HTML file from that Markdown file. Similarly, when an existing Markdown file is updated or deleted, Letterpress updates or deletes the corresponding HTML file.

Letterpress also monitors templates. If any change is detected in any of the template files, Letterpress rebuilds the whole site.

Letterpress also monitors subfolders and other files in *press_folder* but treat them as assets. It maps them directly into `site_dir`. It means if you make an *assets* folder and put images there you can reference them in your posts, e.g., `![Big Headshot](/assets/big_headshot.jpg)`.

Letterpress builds these indices automatically:

* Home index
* Archive indices
* Monthly indices
* Yearly indices
* Tag indices

Letterpress writes logs into *press_folder* so you can easily review what is going on.

# Writing
You write posts in such a natural format:
```
title: Post Title
date: Publishing date in the format specified in letterpress.config. The default format is 01/31/2013.
excerpt: Summary of the post.
tags: math, web

Content of the post…

### Let's have fun with math & physics

$E=m*c^2$

```

Refer to `press/sample_post.md` for a complete example.

# Naming
The recommended naming scheme for post files is to use post title, directly or shortened. Adding date to file names would result in redundant path segment in permalinks since Letterpress already puts the HTML files under folders named after their publish dates.

# Publishing
You can publish posts by putting them in *press_folder* with whatever method you like, e.g., FTP or rsync. However, I highly recommend [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com). This is how you should use Dropbox to publish posts to Letterpress:

1. Of course you must have a Dropbox account. Let's call it *writer's account*.
2. Install Dropbox client on your desktop computer, iPhone, iPad or other devices you write on. Let's call it *writing machine*.
3. Sign in your *writer's account* on your *writing machine*.
4. Have the aforementioned *press_folder* somewhere in Dropbox folder on your *writing machine*.
5. Register another Dropbox account. Let's call it *publisher's account*.
6. Install Dropbox client on your server. Let's call it *publishing  machine*.
7. Sign in your *publisher's account* on your *publishing machine*.
8. Share *press_folder* from your *writer's account* to your *publisher's account*.
9. Now your *writing machine*'s *press_folder* and *publishing machine*'s *press_folder* are in sync. Whenever you put a new post into, edit an existing post in, or delete one from, your *press_folder* on your *writing machine*, Letterpress will generate, update, or delete the corresponding HTML file in *site_dir*(configured in `letterpress.config`) on your *publishing machine*.
