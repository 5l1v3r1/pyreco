:title Maybe Tomorrow
:author Terry Bush

There’s a voice that keeps on calling me<br />
Down the road is where I’ll always be
~~

Every stop I make, I’ll make a new friend<br />
Can’t stay for long, just turn around and I’m gone again.

Maybe tomorrow, I’ll want to settle down,<br />
Until tomorrow, I’ll just keep moving on.

Down this road, that never seems to end,<br />
Where new adventure, lies just around the bend.

So if you want to join me for a while<br />
Just grab your hat, come travel light – that’s hobo style.

Maybe tomorrow, I’ll want to settle down,<br />
Until tomorrow, the whole world is my home.

So if you want to join me for a while<br />
Just grab your hat, come travel light – that’s hobo style.

Maybe tomorrow, I’ll want to settle down,<br />
Until tomorrow, I’ll just keep moving on.

[Instrumental Bridge]

Maybe tomorrow, I’ll want to settle down,<br />
Until tomorrow, I’ll just keep moving on.

There’s a world, that’s waiting to unfold,<br />
A brand new tale, no one has ever told,

We’ve journey’d far but, you know it won’t be long,<br />
We’re almost there and we’ve paid our fare, with the hobo song.

Maybe tomorrow, I’ll want to settle down,<br />
Until tomorrow, I’ll just keep moving on.

So if you want to join me for a while<br />
Just grab your hat, come travel light – that’s hobo style.

Maybe tomorrow, I’ll find what I call home<br />
Until tomorrow, you know I’m free to roam.

## Background

Hobo is an ultra-lightweight blog engine written in Python.  It has two
dependencies, fully integrated into the codebase with no additional
downloads: bottle.py and markdown2.  Because of this fact, it is
extremely customizable and can be extended to incorporate all kinds of
scripts designed for the very popular bottle.py web framework.

Hobo is based on the wonderful software designed by Alexis Sellier named
[toto](http://www.cloudhead.io/toto), written in Ruby.  Additionally,
special thanks goes to [clownfart](http://www.github.com/clownfart) for
his amazing work on
[markdown.css](https://github.com/clownfart/Markdown-CSS) which was used as a framework for the primary css-theme.

The name Hobo is the name of the canine protagonist from [The Littlest Hobo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Littlest_Hobo).

## Features

- About 300kb in size.
- No extra dependencies or installations.
- Easy to deploy.
- No knowledge of HTML necessary.
- Pre-packaged with a stylish theme called [theballoonist.css](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0633266/).
- No databases.
- Easily modified templates that use [SimpleTemplate](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/stpl.html#simpletemplate-syntax) included in the ```/views``` directory.
- Out-of-the-box support for pagination (15-posts per page by default).
- Supports plain-text, html, or [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
- Supports static file serving (images, videos, documents, etc.).

## Installation and Setup

It's pretty much the easiest thing in the world to setup.  It can run as
a standalone client by changing the heroku flag in the ```config.ini```
file to 'off' and then simply calling:


### Deploy Locally
```
$ git clone git@github.com:andrewnelder/hobo.git
$ cd hobo
$ python hobo.py
```

That being said, it's designed for use with heroku.  All you need to do
is:


### Deploy on Heroku

```
$ git clone git@github.com:andrewnelder/hobo.git personal-blog
$ cd personal-blog
$ heroku create --stack cedar personal-blog
$ git push heroku master
```


## Usage

Once you've got everything nicely configured -- the next step is easy.
Take a peek in the ```blog_config.py``` file and make sure everything there
adds up.  All that really needs to be configured are the 'title' and
'author' fields.

Then all you need to do is make your first blog-post.  Just like toto,
all it takes is putting a .txt, .md, or .markdown file in the posts
directory.  The file name should be in the form:

### Filename
```

# Format
$ YYYY-MM-DD-blog-post-title.md

# Example
$ 1984-10-21-good-books-are-hard-to-find.md

```

Then put it on heroku!

### Upload Changes to Heroku
```
$ git add .
$ git commit -am 'Added a new blog post.'
$ git push heroku master
```
