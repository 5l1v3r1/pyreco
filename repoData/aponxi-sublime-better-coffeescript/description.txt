# Changelog
## Version 0.5.4 History by [aponxi](https://github.com/aponxi)

### Log:
* Added Settings to the Package Settings Menu
* Added the following Settings:
  * `watchOnModified` :
      Can be `False`, `True`, or an `Integer`.
      1. If its `false`, the watched CoffeeScript won't be compiled when modified
      2. If its an `Integer` the watched CoffeeScript will be compiled when modified after X seconds. (If you put in 3 then it will be modified only if it has been 3 seconds after the last compile, if you don't make any modifications though, it won't compile until you do)
      3. If its `true` ( _default_ ), the watched CoffeeScript will be compiled when modified after 3 seconds.
  * `watchOnSaved` :
      Can be `True` or `False`.
      This enables compiling when the CoffeeScript you were editing is Saved.

* Added Watch Support
  By default you can press `alt+shift+w` to start the watch mode. It will open an output view which you can close to stop watching. When you are watching your CoffeeScript the compiled output will be inserted in the output view at the begining. After that you can either compile when you modify the CoffeeScript or when you Save it, or both. You can set these settings by going into the package settings. Use the User Settings so that if you upgrade, you won't lose your settings.

### Known Issues:

1. [Issue #1](https://github.com/aponxi/CoffeeScript-Sublime-Plugin/issues/1): If you are watching the file and it compiles whenever you modify without delay, then Sublime Text 2 can be unresponsive. Until this is fixed, please use a delay on `watchOnModified` setting, by either setting it to True, False or something > 0.

# Changelog
## Version 0.5.5 History by [aponxi](https://github.com/aponxi)

### Log:
* Fixed refreshing on modified. Now there is always a delay by default which is 0.5 seconds.
* Now closing the CoffeeScript closes the Compiled JS output.
* When you close the Compiled JS Output view, you stop watch mode.
* `alt+shift+w` successfully toggles watchmode on and off.
* When the CoffeeScript is closed upon watch mode, the code is cleaned up.
* Fixed output messages.
* Removed unused settings

The code runs smoother now. Doesn't slow down. 

On this version worked heavily on WatchMode. And it was a hell of a work!

### v0.6.40 26/May/2013
* added environment PATH settings, to add additional paths to find homebrew node and such
* fixed an issue with the compile and display the output in panel (alt shift R) It was getting the text of the file and running it- thus not finding `required` modules in nodejs. I made it so that it runs the coffee command in the cwd and runs the filename instead of the whole script. In example: `coffee -b -e "my/script.coffee"` but this is run in `/home/projects/my`.
* fixed #41 by adding settings into the command pallet

### v0.6.32 02/Feb/2013
* with help of @idpsycho fixed #14 once more.
* added alert message on compile failed which also works with compile on save

### v0.6.31 25/Jan/2013

* hotfixed default compile dir to be `false`

### v0.6.3 25/Jan/2013
* added compileDir option which specifies `coffee -o` arg when compiling.
* Fixed settings file name. It was Coffeescript when it should have been CoffeeScript. Fixes #19
* compileDir path works only if it exists.
* now also works if it doesn't exist.
* changed default compileDir option to false thus compiling a coffee script to the same directory as default.

### v0.6.2 16/Jan/2013
- Updated package.json, bumped up version.

### v0.6.1 16/Jan/2013
- Added utf-8 encode/decode to prevent unicode decode errors, fixed #17
- Corrected years in 0.6 changelog... Should get used to it by now.
- Added error output in panel which fixes #16

### v0.6 Changelog - 16/Jan/2013

- Changed menu name to "Better Coffeescript"
- Changed menu arguments to be directed to `sublime-better-coffeescript` folders, settings files are still kept as `Coffeescript.sublime-settings`
- Fixed lint errors
- if delay is lower than < 0.5 then we are saying that minimum delay should be 0.5
- added a method that gets the input's filename with .js extension
- setting the output view's name as filename.js fixes #13
- added compileOnSave option fixes #14
- updated readme fixes #6

# Overview

**This package is for Sublime Text 3**. If you are looking for Sublime Text 2, then please refer to [st2 branch here](https://github.com/aponxi/sublime-better-coffeescript/tree/st2).

## Description

CoffeeScript plug-in was originally created by @Xavura. As I began writing a lot of code in CoffeeScript, I felt the need for side-by-side view for compiled CoffeeScript. Since Xavura's repository have been inactive I decided to branch out my own version. The biggest change in my branch is the Watch Mode which updates the compiled JavaScript view whenever you modify the CoffeeScript thus enabling you to view your progress side-by-side.

I use this plug-in almost everyday! Therefore, whenever I am not developing I am in testing. I'll do my best to make sure every request or bug will be answered since I'm a frequent user.

## Contributing

- Please use [aponxi/issues page](https://github.com/aponxi/sublime-better-coffeescript/issues) to make requests or report bugs.
- Please make _pull requests_ to the respective branch (`master` branch is for Sublime Text 3, `st2` branch is for Sublime Text 2.)

# Installation

## via Package Control

> This is the recommended installation method.

If you have [Sublime Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/), you know what to do. If not, well: it's a package manager for Sublime Text 3. Installation guide can be [found here](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation).  After installing the package manager:

* Open the Command Pallete (`ctrl+shift+P` or `cmd+shift+P`).
* Type "Install Package" and hit return.
* Type "Better CoffeeScript" and hit return.

## via Source Control

> If you plan to contribute, then you should install via this method. Otherwise it is recommended that you install the package via Package Control, see above.

Sublime stores packages in the following locations:

	Nix: ~/.config/sublime-text-3/packages
	Mac: ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages
	Win: %APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3\Packages

### As a repository within the packages directory

Open a Terminal/Console and run the following commands, replacing `PACKAGE_PATH` with the path corresponding to your OS above.

	cd PACKAGE_PATH
	git clone https://github.com/aponxi/sublime-better-coffeescript.git "Better CoffeeScript"

### As a repository outside of the packages directory

If you use Github for Mac/Windows which store repositories in a specific location, or if you just don't want a repository in your packages directory, then instead you can use a link.

If you don't yet have the repository, then grab it via your GUI program or via the command line:

	cd WHEREVER_YOU_WANT
	git clone https://github.com/aponxi/sublime-better-coffeescript.git

Once that is done, we will create the link:

#### Windows:

	cd PACKAGE_PATH
	mklink /D "Better CoffeeScript" ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_REPOSITORY

#### Nix/Mac:

	cd PACKAGE_PATH
	ln -s ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_REPOSITORY "Better CoffeeScript"

#### A note on Package Control

When Package Control tries to update your packages, if you have a repository in your packages directory then it will try to pull down and merge any changes. If you don't want this to happen and would rather handle everything yourself, then you can add the following to your settings (Preferences » Package Settings » Package Control » Settings - User):

	"auto_upgrade_ignore": ["Better CoffeeScript"]

# Updating

If you are using Package Control, updating will be automatic and you don't have to worry about it.

If using Source Control:

	cd "PACKAGE_PATH/Better CoffeeScript"
	git fetch origin
	git merge origin/master

# Commands/Shortcuts

You can access the commands either using the command palette (`ctrl+shift+P` or `cmd+shift+P`) or via shortcuts.

	alt+shift+t - Run a Cake task
	alt+shift+r - Run some CoffeeScript (prints output to a panel on the bottom)
	alt+shift+s - Run a syntax check
	alt+shift+c - Compile a file
	alt+shift+d - Display compiled JavaScript
	alt+shift+l - Display lexer tokens
	alt+shift+n - Display parser nodes
	alt+shift+w - Toggle watch mode
	alt+shift+p - Toggle output panel


Context menu has `Compile Output` that compiles the current CoffeeScript and outputs the javascript code that is run, in a panel.

**Note:** Some of the commands use the Status Bar for output, so you'll probably want to enable it (View » Show Status Bar).

# Building

> When using the build system, it is assumed that your `.sublime-project` file lives in your project's base directory (due to limitations with the build system).

Hitting `F7` (Tools » Build) will run the Cake task 'sbuild'.

If you're not quite sure what the point of this is then read on.

Let's say before distributing your project that you would like to combine all of your `.js` files into one and then minify them them using UglifyJS or something.

That's what this is for! You would create a `Cakefile` and inside it you would write a task:

	task 'sbuild', 'Prepare project for distribution.', ->
		# ...

# Settings

Go to `Preferences > Package Settings > CoffeeScript > Settings - User` to change settings.

# FAQ

Most of the linux terminal commands written here can be run via [cygwin](http://cygwin.com/install.html) - aka Linux Terminal in Windows.

- Most of the problems are related to configurations. Remember to configure `binDir` after you install!


- Do I have coffee-script installed?

Try finding coffee-script in your global npm list with `npm ls -g | grep coffee` which will output something like:

```bash
npm ls -g | grep coffee

# will output:
#├── coffee-script@1.6.3
#├─┬ coffeelint@0.5.6
#│ ├── coffee-script@1.6.3
#├── UNMET DEPENDENCY generator-coffee *
#│ │ ├── coffee-script@1.3.3
```


- Where can I find out the path to coffee binary?

In Linux `which` command will tell you where a command originates from. In terminal type:

```bash
which coffee
# /usr/bin/coffee
```

This path will go into the `binDir` setting.

- I'm getting the error message `'coffee' is not recognized as an internal or external command,` when saving.
 
The coffee-script binary probably is not installed. Either install coffee-script or set `checkSyntaxOnSave` and `compileOnSave` to `false` in `Preferences > Package Settings > CoffeeScript > Settings - User`.
