Place your assets like PNG files in this directory and they will be packaged with your module.

If you create a file named mattapp.statusbar.js in this directory, it will be 
compiled and used as your module.  This allows you to run pure Javascript
modules that are pre-compiled.

These files are not yet supported as of 1.4.0 but will be in a near future release.

You can place platform-specific files here in sub-folders named "android" and/or "iphone", just as you can with normal Titanium Mobile SDK projects.  Any folders and files you place here will be merged with the platform-specific files in a Titanium Mobile project that uses this module.

When a Titanium Mobile project that uses this module is built, the files from this platform/ folder will be treated the same as files (if any) from the Titanium Mobile project's platform/ folder.
