Introduction
============

ATpy is a high-level package providing a way to manipulate tables of
astronomical data in a uniform way.

Documentation is available from http://atpy.readthedocs.org/

ATpy is released under an MIT open-source license

Please Note
===========

Much of ATpyâ€™s functionality has now been incorporated into
[Astropy](http://www.astropy.org), and while we will continue to fix bugs, we
are no longer actively developing new features in ATpy, instead focusing our
efforts on Astropy. If you are a new user, and do not need the SQL-querying
functionality, we recommend using [Astropy
Tables](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/table/) directly.
