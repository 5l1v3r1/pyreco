This directory contains a set of scripts/html files for viewing
html5lib parse trees in the browser. The main script, parsetree.py is
intended to be run as a CGI script. It is assumed it will live at a
relative URI /cgi-bin/parsetree/parsetree.py If this is not the case
the HTML files must be edited to point to the actual location of the
script.

Dependencies:

html5lib - http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/
Genshi - http://genshi.edgewall.org/

A utility for determining and visulising html table cell-headers
relationships, designed to make it possible to prototype different
headers algorithms easilly.

Requirements:
html5lib - Latest SVN 
lxml - 1.3.x should work; 2.0 series may have problems with html5lib
Genshi - 0.4+

Tests of the table parser require nose

# developers.whatwg.org

This repository contains scripts that will generate a pristine copy of [developers.whatwg.org](developers.whatwg.org). It uses a collection of arcane python scripts supplied by the W3C, and my own Ruby scripts that remove cruft.

To build your own copy, checkout this repostory, you'll need:

* Ruby (any version)
* Python (2.4+)
* Subversion
* LibXML2

To install dependencies: 

```bash
bundle install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run `make clean` then `make` to produce the required contents (final output is written to the `public` directory)
The contents of `public` are exactly what I have deployed to developers.whatwg.org.

If you're hoping to contribute to spec content, you'll need to talk to [Hixie](http://twitter.com/Hixie), as for styling and display of this content, I'm your manâ€¦ and this is the repo.
