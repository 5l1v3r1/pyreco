How To Install
==============

Install in Sphinx
-----------------

Copy this directory into the ``sphinx/templates`` directory where Shpinx is installed. For example, a standard install of sphinx on Mac OS X is at ``/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/Sphinx-0.6.3-py2.6.egg/``

Install Somewhere Else
----------------------

If you want to install this theme somewhere else, you will have to modify the ``conf.py`` file. ::

    templates_path = ['/absolute/path/to/dir/','relative/path/']

Making Sphinx Use the Theme
---------------------------

Edit the ``conf.py`` file and make the following setting: ::

    html_theme = 'ADCtheme'

Pyres - a Resque clone
======================

[Resque](http://github.com/defunkt/resque) is a great implementation of a job queue by the people at github. It's written in ruby, which is great, but I primarily work in python. So I took on the task of porting over the code to python and PyRes was the result


## Project Goals

Because of some differences between ruby and python, there are a couple of places where I chose speed over correctness. The goal will be to eventually take the application and make it more pythonic without sacrificing the awesome functionality found in resque. At the same time, I hope to stay within the bounds of the original api and web interface.

## Travis CI

Currently, pyres is being tested via travis ci for python version 2.6, 2.7, and 3.3: 
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/binarydud/pyres.png)](http://travis-ci.org/binarydud/pyres)

## Running Tests

 1. Install nose: `$ easy_install nose`
 2. Start redis: `$ redis-server [PATH_TO_YOUR_REDIS_CONFIG]`
 3. Run nose: `$ nosetests` Or more verbosely: `$ nosetests -v`
