The Python static website generator with potential
--------------------------------------------------

**Another static website generator?**

Sure, why not :)? The number of static site generators is continuously
growing, but so far I have yet to find a flexible static site that suits my
needs. So I decided to write my own.

**What's so different about Volt?**

Here are some of my favorite features:

1. **Automatic pagination**

   Say you have a blog with 10 posts, each with its own set of tags that might
   might not be present in all posts. By only by supplying the URL pattern,
   Volt can generate the pages containing each blog post  categorized by tag,
   paginated to your liking.

   For example, you only need to supply ``tag/{tags}`` and Volt will generate
   links to the pages ``tag/foo``, ``tag/bar``, ``tag/baz``, where each of these
   page will contain all the posts sharing that tag.

   And this doesn't apply only to tags. You can use it to create pages based on
   authors, time (year, day, date, whatever you want), and any other data you
   put in your posts. 

   All with a simple URL pattern in the configuration file, like so ::

       PAGINATIONS = ('', 'tag/{tags}', '{time:%Y}', '{time:%Y/%m}', '{time:%Y/%m/%d}')


2. **Auto-regenerating built-in server**

   Static sites need to be generated repeatedly to reflect changes in their source.
   After a while, doing this becomes cumbersome and annoying. Volt's server
   automatically generates your static site whenever it detects changes in the
   source and the configuration file, so you can focus on experimenting with your
   actual site contents.


3. **Modularity and extensibility**

   Under the hood, Volt is actually a collection of different engines
   responsible for different sections of your site. The blog engine, for
   example generates the blog section of your site, while the plain engine,
   generates simple web pages. `See how simple the blog engine code is
   <http://github.com/bow/volt/blob/master/volt/engine/builtins/blog.py>`_ 
   or take a peek at the `main site generator function 
   <http://github.com/bow/volt/blob/master/volt/generator.py>`_ to get a
   picture of how the engines work.
  
   Finally, Volt comes with a plugin architecture that lets you hook into the
   engines' actions. Seven plugins comes packed in with volt: 

   - Atom feed generator plugin (atomic, no extra dependency)

   - Markup processing plugins:

     - reStructured text (rst_parser, requires
       `docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>`_)

     - Markdown (markdown_parser, requires `python-markdown
       <http://freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/Installation>`_

     - Textile (textile_parser, requires `python-textile 
       <https://github.com/chrisdrackett/python-textile>`_)
   
   - Syntax highlighter plugin (syntax, requires `pygments
     <http://pygments.org/>`_)

   - CSS minifier plugin (css_minifier, requires `cssmin
     <https://github.com/zacharyvoase/cssmin>`_)

   - Javascript minifier plugin (js_minifier, requires `jsmin
     <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/jsmin>`_)

   `Browse their code 
   <http://github.com/bow/volt/tree/master/volt/plugin/builtins>`_ 
   to see how you can easily write your own plugin.


4. **Centrally-managed configuration with flexible options**

   Sort your content according to time, or title, or author name, or tags,
   anything you want. Set global values for all content, e.g. authors for all
   blog posts. Define your own Jinja2 tests or filters. Set the plugin options.
   You can do all these in Volt through one central configuration file: 
   ``voltconf.py``, conveniently accessible in your project folder.


All these with the perks of static websites: easy deployment,
easy back-up and tracking, security, and speed.


------------
INSTALLATION
------------

Latest version from PyPI (0.0.3): ``pip install volt``

Bleeding edge from main development repo: ``pip install git+https://github.com/bow/volt.git``

Volt is still in alpha and under heavy development. Things will break here and
there, but it's usable enough for creating real websites:

* `bow.web.id <http://bow.web.id/>`_ (`source <http://github.com/bow/volt>`_,
  using the latest development version)

* `spaetzblog <http://sspaeth.de/>`_

Dependency:

* `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/>`_

Optional dependencies:

* `python-markdown <http://freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/Installation>`_
  (installed by default for ``volt demo``, can be safely removed if not used)

Python versions:

* Volt is tested against Python versions 2.6, 2.7, and 3.3.


-----
USAGE
-----

Go through a superquick demo of Volt by running ``volt demo`` in an empty
directory and opening ``localhost:8000`` in your browser.

Here's a quick summary of the currently available commands:

* ``volt init``: Starts a Volt project, must be run inside an empty directory.
  The ``voltconf.py`` file created by this command currently contains almost all
  the default settings. You can safely edit or remove them.

* ``volt demo``: Starts the demo, must be run inside an empty directory.

* ``volt gen``: Generates the website into a ``site`` folder in your current
  project directory.

* ``volt serve``: Generates the website and Starts the server pointing to the
  ``site`` directory.

* ``volt ext``: Adds a template for writing your custom engine, plugin, or
  widget. Custom engines and plugins are stored respectively inside the 
  ``engines`` and ``plugins`` directory in the root Volt project directory.
  Widgets are stored inside ``widgets.py`` in the same directory. You can also
  specify an additional ``--builtin`` to copy a builtin engine/plugin/widget
  to your Volt project directory.

* ``volt version``: Shows the current Volt version.

All of the commands except for ``init`` and ``demo`` can be run from anywhere
inside a Volt project directory.

The docs are, unfortunately, minimum at the moment. For now, the source is the
primary documentation.

Welcome to your first Volt website!

Volt is a static website generator that strives for versatility and
ease of use. It is written in pure Python, backed by the powerful Jinja2
template engine. Use it to generate static HTML files once and serve the
resulting website anywhere you want.

This website is a small example of what you can do with Volt. Everything
needed to generate this site was taken from three source directories:
**contents**, containing the actual contents of the site;
**templates**, containing the HTML template files, and
**assets**, for all other files such as css or image files. All
settings that determines the behaviors and looks of the generated site are
configurable via **voltconf.py**, Volt's central configuration file.

Play around with the source files and see how it affects this site by
running **volt gen** and **volt serve** afterwards. Finally,
start building your own Volt site by running **volt init** and have
fun :)!

Birds taught me to sing, when they took me to their king, first I had to fly, in the sky so high so high, so high so high so high, so - if you want to sing this way, think of what you'd like to say, add a tune and you will see, just how easy it can be. Treacle pudding, fish and chips, fizzy drinks and liquorice, flowers, rivers, sand and sea, snowflakes and the stars are free. La la la la la, la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la la la la la, so - Barnaby The Bear's my name, never call me Jack or James, I will sing my way to fame, Barnaby the Bear's my name.

This is an example of a simple page processed by **Plain Engine**. Not that
different apparently, from the blog pages. But this is a whole different
section of the site. The URL is different, and the processing logic is
slightly different.

Take a look at the [source code](http://github.com/bow/volt/blob/master/volt/engine) 
to see the similarities and differences of the Blog engine and Plain engine. 
Try turning the plain engine off by removing its entry in **voltconf.py** and see
what happens to this page. Try messing with the URL, try changing the permalink, try
all the things :D!

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.
