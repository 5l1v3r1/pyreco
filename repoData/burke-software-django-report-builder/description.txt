django-report-builder
=====================

A GUI for Django ORM. Build custom queries and display results. Targets sys admins and capable end users who might 
not be able to program or gain direct interactive shell access.

# News

We are hiring http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/53040/open-source-django-web-developer-remote-full-burke-software-and-consulting

Just pushed 2.0 changes to master and pypi. Code has been refactored. Report any bugs :)

- Changing the base templates slightly (could cause you trouble if customized)
- Factoring out functions to django-report-utils
- Added experimental support for asynchronous report generation

The common functions will used in:

- django-scaffold-report - a tool to streamline complex customized reports
- django-admin-export - a super old tool I made that sucks and will be remade!


# What is Django Report Builder?

![](https://raw.github.com/burke-software/django-report-builder/master/screenshots/reportbuilderscreen.png)

What's finished?
- Add filters
- Add display fields
- Preview and create xlsx reports
- Very simple security, user must have change or "view" permission to view 
reports. Unprivileged users can still build reports and see database schema.
- Model properties (thanks yekibud)
- Support for [django-custom-fields](https://github.com/burke-software/django-custom-field)
- Export to Report global admin action
- Optional asynchronous report generation

What isn't
- "or" filters together
- More exports, views
- Decent form validation
