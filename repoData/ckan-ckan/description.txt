CKAN Solr schema
================

This folder contains the Solr schema file used by CKAN (schema.xml).

Starting from 2.2 this is the only file that should be used by users and
modified by devs. The rest of files (schema-{version}.xml) are kept for
backwards compatibility purposes and should not be used, as they might be
removed in future versions.

When upgrading CKAN, always check the CHANGELOG on each release to see if
you need to update the schema file and reindex your datasets.

Select2
=======

Select2 is a jQuery-based replacement for select boxes. It supports searching, remote data sets, and infinite scrolling of results.

To get started, checkout examples and documentation at http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2

Use cases
---------

* Enhancing native selects with search.
* Enhancing native selects with a better multi-select interface.
* Loading data from JavaScript: easily load items via ajax and have them searchable.
* Nesting optgroups: native selects only support one level of nested. Select2 does not have this restriction.
* Tagging: ability to add new items on the fly.
* Working with large, remote datasets: ability to partially load a dataset based on the search term.
* Paging of large datasets: easy support for loading more pages when the results are scrolled to the end.
* Templating: support for custom rendering of results and selections.

Browser compatibility
---------------------
* IE 8+
* Chrome 8+
