## cmudict.0.7a

The CMU pronunciation dictionary. Used under the BSD-like license that appears
at the top of the file.

## iso639.txt

`iso639.txt` is an incomplete mapping between ISO language codes and English
language names.

It was retrieved from
http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/iso-languagecodes.txt, a file that is
part of the GeoNames geographical database.  GeoNames is released under a
Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license, and is hosted at http://geonames.org.

Some parenthetical clarifications were removed: for example, we've removed "
(macrolanguage)" from the ends of a few language names, renamed "Modern Greek
(1453-)" to "Greek", and removed date ranges from language names that were
already unique.

## zh_frames.json

A mapping from ID numbers to sentence frames from the Traditional Chinese
version of ConceptNet 4. Extracted from data files sent by Yen-Ling Kuo.

The `input/` directory here contains a very small set of input data representing each input source, and `output/` contains the expected output when it is run through the appropriate reader. This is used for testing (see the `tests` directory).

To get the full set of input data for ConceptNet, run "make download" in the `data` directory.

The Makefile will download data into this directory.

ConceptNet aims to give computers access to common-sense knowledge, the kind of
information that ordinary people know but usually leave unstated.

This Python package contains a toolset for loading new datasets into ConceptNet
5, and it serves the HTML and JSON Web APIs for it. You don't need it to simply
access ConceptNet 5; see http://conceptnet5.media.mit.edu for more information.

If you're interested in using ConceptNet, please join the conceptnet-users Google
group: http://groups.google.com/group/conceptnet-users?hl=en
