    "description": "Concurrence is a framework for creating massively concurrent network applications in Python.  It takes a Lightweight-tasks-with-message-passing approach to concurrency.  The goal of Concurrence is to provide an easier programming model for writing high performance network applications than existing solutions (Multi-threading, Twisted, asyncore etc).",
