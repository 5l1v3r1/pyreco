Releasing
=========
* Run the tests and ensure they all pass
* Update CHANGELOG.rst
* Update the version in ``cassandra/__init__.py``
* Commit the changelog and version changes
* Tag the release.  For example: ``git tag -a 1.0.0 -m 'version 1.0.0'``
* Push the commit and tag: ``git push --tags origin master``
* Upload the package to pypi::

    python setup.py register
    python setup.py sdist upload

* Update the docs (see below)
* Append a 'post' string to the version tuple in ``cassandra/__init__.py``
  so that it looks like ``(x, y, z, 'post')``
* Commit and push

Building the Docs
=================
Sphinx is required to build the docs. You probably want to install through apt,
if possible::

    sudo apt-get install python-sphinx

pip may also work::

    sudo pip install -U Sphinx

To build the docs, run::

    python setup.py doc

To upload the docs, checkout the ``gh-pages`` branch (it's usually easier to
clone a second copy of this repo and leave it on that branch) and copy the entire
contents all of ``docs/_build/X.Y.Z/*`` into the root of the ``gh-pages`` branch
and then push that branch to github.

For example::

    python setup.py doc
    cp -R docs/_build/1.0.0-beta1/* ~/python-driver-docs/
    cd ~/python-driver-docs
    git add --all
    git commit -m 'Update docs'
    git push origin gh-pages

Running the Tests
=================
In order for the extensions to be built and used in the test, run::

    python setup.py nosetests

You can run a specific test module or package like so::

    python setup.py nosetests -w tests/unit/

If you want to test all of python 2.6, 2.7, and pypy, use tox (this is what
TravisCI runs)::

    tox

By default, tox only runs the unit tests because I haven't put in the effort
to get the integration tests to run on TravicCI.  However, the integration
tests should work locally.  To run them, edit the following line in tox.ini::

    commands = {envpython} setup.py build_ext --inplace nosetests --verbosity=2 tests/unit/

and change ``tests/unit/`` to ``tests/``.

DataStax Python Driver for Apache Cassandra
===========================================

.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/datastax/python-driver.png?branch=master
   :target: https://travis-ci.org/datastax/python-driver

A Python client driver for Apache Cassandra.  This driver works exclusively
with the Cassandra Query Language v3 (CQL3) and Cassandra's native
protocol.

The driver supports Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4.

Installation
------------
Installation through pip is recommended::

    $ pip install cassandra-driver

For more complete installation instructions, see the
`installation guide <http://datastax.github.io/python-driver/installation.html>`_.

Documentation
-------------
The documentation can be found online `here <http://datastax.github.io/python-driver/index.html>`_.

Reporting Problems
------------------
Please report any bugs and make any feature requests on the
`JIRA <https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/PYTHON>`_ issue tracker.

If you would like to contribute, please feel free to open a pull request.

Getting Help
------------
Your two best options for getting help with the driver are the
`mailing list <https://groups.google.com/a/lists.datastax.com/forum/#!forum/python-driver-user>`_
and the IRC channel.

For IRC, use the #datastax-drivers channel on irc.freenode.net.  If you don't have an IRC client,
you can use `freenode's web-based client <http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#datastax-drivers>`_.

Features to be Added
--------------------
* C extension for encoding/decoding messages
* Twisted support
* IPv6 Support
