Pull Requests are great (on the **dev** branch)! Readme/Documentation changes
are ok in the master branch.

 1. Fork the Repo on github.
 2. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, please add a test!
 3. Add your name to AUTHORS.txt
 4. Push to your fork and submit a **pull request to the dev branch**.

My **master** branch is a 100% stable (should be). I only push to it after I am
certain that things are working out. Many people are using Jedi directly from
the github master branch.

**Try to use the PEP8 style guide.**


Changing Issues to Pull Requests (Github)
-----------------------------------------

If you have have previously filed a GitHub issue and want to contribute code
that addresses that issue, we prefer it if you use
[hub](https://github.com/github/hub) to convert your existing issue to a pull
request. To do that, first push the changes to a separate branch in your fork
and then issue the following command:

    hub pull-request -b davidhalter:dev -i <issue-number> -h <your-github-username>:<your-branch-name>

It's no strict requirement though, if you don't have hub installed or prefer to
use the web interface, then feel free to post a traditional pull request.

Jedi is an autocompletion tool for Python that can be used in IDEs/editors.
Jedi works. Jedi is fast. It understands all of the basic Python syntax
elements including many builtin functions.

Additionaly, Jedi suports two different goto functions and has support for
renaming as well as Pydoc support and some other IDE features.

Jedi uses a very simple API to connect with IDE's. There's a reference
implementation as a `VIM-Plugin <https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim>`_,
which uses Jedi's autocompletion.  I encourage you to use Jedi in your IDEs.
It's really easy. If there are any problems (also with licensing), just contact
me.

Jedi can be used with the following editors:

- Vim (jedi-vim_, YouCompleteMe_)
- Emacs (Jedi.el_, elpy_, company-jedi_)
- Sublime Text (SublimeJEDI_ [ST2 + ST3], anaconda_ [only ST3])
- SynWrite_
- TextMate_ (Not sure if it's actually working)
- Kate_ version 4.13+ supports it natively, you have to enable it, though. [`proof
  <https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/applications/kate/repository/show?rev=KDE%2F4.13>`_]

And it powers the following projects:

- wdb_ - Web Debugger


Here are some pictures:

Pydoc support (with highlighting, Shift+k).

There is also support for goto and renaming.

Get the latest version from `github <https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi>`_
(master branch should always be kind of stable/working).

Docs are available at `https://jedi.jedidjah.ch/
<https://jedi.jedidjah.ch/>`_. Pull requests with documentation
enhancements and/or fixes are awesome and most welcome. Jedi uses `semantic
versioning <http://semver.org/>`_.


Installation
============

    pip install jedi

Note: This just installs the Jedi library, not the editor plugins. For
information about how to make it work with your editor, refer to the
corresponding documentation.

You don't want to use ``pip``? Please refer to the `manual
<https://jedi.jedidjah.ch/en/latest/docs/installation.html>`_.


Feature Support and Caveats
===========================

Jedi really understands your Python code. For a comprehensive list what Jedi
can do, see: `Features
<https://jedi.jedidjah.ch/en/latest/docs/features.html>`_. A list of
caveats can be found on the same page.

You can run Jedi on cPython 2.6, 2.7, 3.2 or 3.3, but it should also
understand/parse code older than those versions.

Tips on how to use Jedi efficiently can be found `here
<https://jedi.jedidjah.ch/en/latest/docs/recipes.html>`_.


API for IDEs
============

It's very easy to create an editor plugin that uses Jedi. See `Plugin API
<https://jedi.jedidjah.ch/en/latest/docs/plugin-api.html>`_ for more
information.

If you have specific questions, please add an issue or ask on `stackoverflow
<https://stackoverflow.com>`_ with the label ``python-jedi``.


Development
===========

There's a pretty good and extensive `development documentation
<https://jedi.jedidjah.ch/en/latest/docs/development.html>`_.


Testing
=======

The test suite depends on ``tox`` and ``pytest``::

    pip install tox pytest

To run the tests for all supported Python versions::

    tox

If you want to test only a specific Python version (e.g. Python 2.7), it's as
easy as ::

    tox -e py27

Tests are also run automatically on `Travis CI
<https://travis-ci.org/davidhalter/jedi/>`_.

This directory contains pre-compiled extensions modules used to test completions
for compiled modules on Travis-CI (Ubuntu 12.04 64bit).

To build the extensions modules, run::

    python setup.py build_ext -i


Then move the compiled modules to their testing package ( ./**compiledXX**, where XX is the
python version used to run setup.py).
