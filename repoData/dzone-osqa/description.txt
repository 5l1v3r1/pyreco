this directory contains sample commands to be executed
by cron 

files with names ending "virtuanenv" should work under Python virtualenv system
other files - with standard unix setup

directory for media common to all or many templates

{{ obj.html|safe }}
this directory contains available skins

1) default - default skin with templates
2) common - this directory is to media directory common to all or many templates

to create a new skin just create another directory under skins/
and start populating it with the directory structure as in
default/templates - templates must be named the same way

NO NEED TO CREATE ALL TEMPLATES/MEDIA FILES AT ONCE

templates are resolved in the following way:
* check in skin named as in settings.OSQA_DEFAULT_SKIN
* then skin named 'default'

media is resolved with one extra option
* settings.OSQA_DEFAULT_SKIN
* 'default'
* 'common'

media does not have to be composed of files named the same way as in default skin
whatever media you link to from your templates - will be in operation

This directory is to contain uploaded images and other files
must be writable by the webserver

you can change the location of this folder using the admin panel
keep this folder writable
Full text search (using sphinx search)

Currently full text search works only with sphinx search engine
And builtin PostgreSQL (postgres only >= 8.3???)

5.1 Instructions for Sphinx search setup
Sphinx at this time supports only MySQL and PostgreSQL databases
to enable this, install sphinx search engine and djangosphinx

configure sphinx, sample configuration can be found in
sphinx/sphinx.conf file usually goes somewhere in /etc tree

build osqa index first time manually

% indexer --config /path/to/sphinx.conf --index osqa

setup cron job to rebuild index periodically with command
your crontab entry may be something like

0 9,15,21 * * * /usr/local/bin/indexer --config /etc/sphinx/sphinx.conf --all --rotate >/dev/null 2>&1
adjust it as necessary this one will reindex three times a day at 9am 3pm and 9pm

if your forum grows very big ( good luck with that :) you'll
need to two search indices one diff index and one main
please refer to online sphinx search documentation for the information
on the subject http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/

in settings.py look for INSTALLED_APPS
and uncomment #'djangosphinx',
