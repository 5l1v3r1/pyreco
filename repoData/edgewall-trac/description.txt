This directory contains useful contributed scripts and programs for Trac.

Please note that these scripts are provided AS-IS are NOT tested to the same
extent as the main sources. They are usually maintained by the original
author, typically listed at the top of the source file.

See ../THANKS for a list of contributors.
There are two more workflows available, original-workflow and basic-workflow.
Look in trac/ticket/workflows for them.  (They are used internally by Trac, so
they aren't here in the contrib tree.)

See the toplevel Makefile (make help).

About Trac

This directory contains files used by Trac's default Genshi templates.

Local modifications to these files might be lost during the installation of
a new Trac version. This can be avoided by making a copy of this entire
directory before beginning modifications.

This directory contains Trac's default Genshi templates.

It is not advised to make local modifications to those files after
installation, as they might be lost during the installation of a new
Trac version.

As an alternative, you can copy the templates you want to modify and
place them in the templates/ directory of your Trac environment or in
the location specified in the trac.ini file under the `[inherit]
templates_dir` setting (the former having precedence over the latter).

Nevertheless, if you use such a locally modified template, it will be
easy to miss the functionality provided by a newer version of the
template, after an upgrade. Because of that, the preferred way to
alter the output would be to write plugins doing Genshi stream
transformation (see for example the sample-plugins/ticket_clone.py),
as this is robust when upgrading to a newer version of Trac: you only
have to check that your filtering still matches and that the
transformation works as expected...
