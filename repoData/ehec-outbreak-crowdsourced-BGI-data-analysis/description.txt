The aim of this repository is to gather the results of the analysis being done worldwide of the EHEC E. coli that has caused the outbreak in Germany.

This directory contains multisequence alignments of coding sequences
(CDS). The alignments are global alignments generated semiautomatically
from blast searched. The blast results are realigned with mafft/linsi. If
possible ends are filled before realigning. The aligments are not perfect
and partial sequences eventually show an artefact typical for linsi,
which moves the terminal base of a partial sequence to the end of the
whole alignment.

The alignments are suited for viewing with clustalx-1.83.

Era7 automatic annotation of Life Tech - University of Muenster assembly of the E. coli LB226692 genome

This folder contains the results of the automatic annotation of the E. coli LB226692 assembly done by Life Tech and University of Muenster. 

This annotation was done by Oh no sequences! team (www.ohnosequences.com) at Era7 (www.era7bioinformatics.com) using BG7 system (http://www.slideshare.net/marina_manrique/bg7-a-new-system-for-bacterial-genome-annotation-designed-for-ngs-data).

Date of the annotation: 8-Jun

This folder contains the results of manual annotations we've done based on the automatic annotations we did with BG7 pipelinehttps://github.com/ehec-outbreak-crowdsourced/BGI-data-analysis/tree/master/strains/TY2482/annotations/era7bioinformaticsThis manual analysis is focused on detecting predicted protein with potential implications in pathogenicity and virulence.
