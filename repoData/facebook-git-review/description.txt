git-review
==========
git-review is a tool for reviewing diffs in a git repository.

It provides a simple CLI for stepping through the modified files, and viewing
the differences with an external diff tool.  This is very convenient if you
prefer using an interactive side-by-side diff viewer.  Although you could also
use the ``GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF`` environment variable with ``git diff``,
git-review provides much more flexibility for moving between files and
selecting which versions to diff.

This package provides a python API for accessing a git repository.  It is very
similar in purpose to the GitPython library: http://gitorious.org/git-python
Eventually it would be nice to switch to using GitPython, since it has a larger
community supporting it.

One of the bigger things that will probably require changing are the special
":wd" and ":0" commit names used by this package.  The review code currently
uses these to access the working directory and index as if they were commits.
The review code will probably need to migrate away from this behavior in order
to switch to GitPython.

There may also be a few features in this package that need to be merged into
GitPython in order to make the switch.
