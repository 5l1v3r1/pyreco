# Alpha

This is a project to convert multimarkdown spec files into multi-page pdfs. This is currently designed around the script gitmmd2pdf.py

## gitmmd2pdf.py

This is a script which converts a multimarkdown file into a multi-page pdf to serve from opencompute.org

Within the <project>/spec directory:

    ../../alpha/gitmg2pdf.py -f <spec file>

## Requirements [INCOMPLETE]

You need [xelatex](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=xetex) installed on your system, with all the latex extras.

In this directory are the following modified files:

    mmd-memoir-packages.tex
    mmd-article-begin-doc.tex
    mmd-article-header.tex
   
## Fonts

The script needs the VistaSlabReg and VistaSlabAltReg TrueType fonts installed.

## Latex packages

The list of latex packages required are:


This is the AMD_server_V2 Incubation project.
# About the Roadrunner Specification

The Roadrunner specification represents a proposal for consideration by the Open Compute community. Once it's approved by the Incubation Committee, it will become part of the OCP Motherboard Project.

This is the Intel_server_V2 Incubation project.
# About the Decathlete Specification

The Decathlete specification represents a proposal for consideration by the Open Compute community. Once it's approved by the Incubation Committee, it will become part of the OCP Motherboard Project.
This is the Open Rack Incubation project.

Specs and some CAD files are available in the /spec directory. However, the Open Rack 1.0 STEP file can be downloaded from the OCP site at:

You can find the charter in /charter.


This is the Open Vault Incubation project.
# About this Specification

This specification represents a proposal for consideration by the Open Compute community. Once it's approved by the Incubation Committee, it will become part of the OCP Storage Project.

# Open Compute Project

Welcome to our beta Git repository. In it you will find specs in multimarkdown for our Intel and AMD V2 motherboard Incubation Projects, as well as a preliminary spec for the Open Rack Incubation Project and a charter for the Open Hardware Management Incubation Project. Mechanical CAD files will be forthcoming. We also have a small project, called Alpha, for converting multimarkdown specs into multi-page pdfs. It is non-functional until the instructions for installing all the latex tools are documented.

One thing to note: the OCP logos for HTML and PDF generation are in /alpha/images. You will need to manually symlink the images in there to a particular project's images folder. The gitmmd2pdf.py script will do this for you, but this script won't generate nice output or compile unless you have all the latex tools installed.
