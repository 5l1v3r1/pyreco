Generate GitHub-style punchcard charts with ease.

    python punchcard.py sample.csv output.png "Sample Chart"

![Sample](http://i.imgur.com/I50Rejy.png)

### Dependencies

    brew install py2cairo pango pygtk

### Command Line

    python punchcard.py input.csv output.png [title]

### Programmatically

    punchcard(png_path, data, row_labels, col_labels)

`data` must be a two-dimensional array of data for the punchcard chart (a list of lists where each list is a row). `len(data) == len(row_labels)` and `len(data[0]) == len(col_labels)`

The following keyword arguments are also allowed.
