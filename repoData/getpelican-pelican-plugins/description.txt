Asset management
----------------

This plugin allows you to use the `Webassets`_ module to manage assets such as
CSS and JS files. The module must first be installed::

    pip install webassets

The Webassets module allows you to perform a number of useful asset management
functions, including:

* CSS minifier (``cssmin``, ``yui_css``, ...)
* CSS compiler (``less``, ``sass``, ...)
* JS minifier (``uglifyjs``, ``yui_js``, ``closure``, ...)

Others filters include CSS URL rewriting, integration of images in CSS via data
URIs, and more. Webassets can also append a version identifier to your asset
URL to convince browsers to download new versions of your assets when you use
far-future expires headers. Please refer to the `Webassets documentation`_ for
more information.

When used with Pelican, Webassets is configured to process assets in the
``OUTPUT_PATH/theme`` directory. You can use Webassets in your templates by
including one or more template tags. The Jinja variable ``{{ ASSET_URL }}`` can
be used in templates and is relative to the ``theme/`` url. The
``{{ ASSET_URL }}`` variable should be used in conjunction with the
``{{ SITEURL }}`` variable in order to generate URLs properly. For example:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% assets filters="cssmin", output="css/style.min.css", "css/inuit.css", "css/pygment-monokai.css", "css/main.css" %}
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ ASSET_URL }}">
    {% endassets %}

... will produce a minified css file with a version identifier that looks like:

.. code-block:: html

    <link href="http://{SITEURL}/theme/css/style.min.css?b3a7c807" rel="stylesheet">

These filters can be combined. Here is an example that uses the SASS compiler
and minifies the output:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% assets filters="sass,cssmin", output="css/style.min.css", "css/style.scss" %}
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ ASSET_URL }}">
    {% endassets %}

Another example for Javascript:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% assets filters="uglifyjs", output="js/packed.js", "js/jquery.js", "js/base.js", "js/widgets.js" %}
        <script src="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ ASSET_URL }}"></script>
    {% endassets %}

The above will produce a minified JS file:

.. code-block:: html

    <script src="http://{SITEURL}/theme/js/packed.js?00703b9d"></script>

Pelican's debug mode is propagated to Webassets to disable asset packaging
and instead work with the uncompressed assets.

If you need to create named bundles (for example, if you need to compile SASS
files before minifying with other CSS files), you can use the ``ASSET_BUNDLES``
variable in your settings file. This is an ordered sequence of 3-tuples, where
the 3-tuple is defined as ``(name, args, kwargs)``. This tuple is passed to the
`environment's register() method`_. The following will compile two SCSS files
into a named bundle, using the ``pyscss`` filter:

.. code-block:: python

    ASSET_BUNDLES = (
        ('scss', ['colors.scss', 'main.scss'], {'filters': 'pyscss'}),
    )

Many of Webasset's available compilers have additional configuration options
(i.e. 'Less', 'Sass', 'Stylus', 'Closure_js').  You can pass these options to
Webassets using the ``ASSET_CONFIG`` in your settings file.

The following will handle Google Closure's compilation level and locate
LessCSS's binary:

.. code-block:: python

    ASSET_CONFIG = (('closure_compressor_optimization', 'WHITESPACE_ONLY'),
                    ('less_bin', 'lessc.cmd'), )

If you wish to place your assets in locations other than the theme output
directory, you can use ``ASSET_SOURCE_PATHS`` in your settings file to provide
webassets with a list of additional directories to search, relative to the
theme's top-level directory. For example:

.. code-block:: python

   ASSET_SOURCE_PATHS = (
       'vendor/css',
       'scss',
   )

Summary
===========

This plug-in:

- Adds a `style="width: ???px; height: auto;"` attribute to any `<img>` tags in the content, by checking
the dimensions of the image file and adding the appropriate `style="width: ???px; height: auto;"` to the `<img>` tag.
- Also finds any `div class="figures"` tags in the content, that contain images and adds the same style to them too.
- If RESPONSIVE_IMAGES setting is true, it adds `style="width: ???px; max-width: 100%; height: auto;"` instead.
- Corrects Alt text: If an img alt attribute = the image filename, it sets it to ""


Assuming that the image is 250px wide, it turns output like this:

	<div class="figure">
	    <img alt="/static/images/image.jpg" src="/static/images/image.jpg" />
	    <p class="caption">
	        This is the caption of the figure.
	    </p>
	    <div class="legend">
	        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod
	        tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
	    </div>
	</div>

into output like this:

	<div class="figure" style="width: 250px; height: auto;">
	    <img style="width: 250px; height: auto;" alt="" src="/static/images/image.jpg" />
	    <p class="caption">
	        This is the caption of the figure.
	    </p>
	    <div class="legend">
	        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod
	        tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
	    </div>
	</div>

or this, if RESPONSIVE_IMAGES = True:

	<div class="figure" style="width: 250px; max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
	    <img style="width: 250px; max-width: 100%; height: auto;" alt="" src="/static/images/image.jpg" />
	    <p class="caption">
	        This is the caption of the figure.
	    </p>
	    <div class="legend">
	        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod
	        tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
	    </div>
	</div>

#Clean Summary Plugin#

Plugin to clean your summary of excess images. Images can take up much more
space than text and lead to summaries being different sizes on archive and 
index pages. With this plugin you can specify a maximum number of images that
will appear in your summaries.

There is also an option to include a minimum of one image.

##Settings##

This plugin has two settings. `CLEAN_SUMMARY_MAXIMUM` which takes an int, and 
`CLEAN_SUMMARY_MINIMUM_ONE` which takes a boolean. They default to 0 and False.

`CLEAN_SUMMARY_MAXIMUM` sets the maximum number of images that will appear in 
your summary.

if `CLEAN_SUMMARY_MINIMUM_ONE` is set to `True` and your summary doesn't already
contain an image, the plugin will add the first image in your article (if one 
exists) to the beginning of the summary.

##Requirements##

Requires Beautiful Soup:

    pip install BeautifulSoup4


##Usage with Summary Plugin##

If using the summary plugin, make sure summary appears in your plugins before
clean summary. Eg.

    PLUGINS = ['summary', 'clean_summary', ... ]

Include Pygments highlighted code with reStructuredText
=======================================================

:author: Colin Dunklau

Use this plugin to make writing coding tutorials easier! You can
maintain the example source files separately from the actual article.

Based heavily on ``docutils.parsers.rst.directives.Include``. Include
a file and output as a code block formatted with pelican's Pygments
directive.

Note that this is broken with the Docutils 0.10 release, there's a
circular import. It was fixed in trunk:
http://sourceforge.net/p/docutils/bugs/214/

Directives
----------

.. code:: rst

    .. code-include:: incfile.py
        :lexer: string, name of the Pygments lexer to use, default 'text'
        :encoding: string, encoding with which to open the file
        :tab-width: integer, hard tabs are replaced with `tab-width` spaces
        :start-line: integer, starting line to begin reading include file
        :end-line: integer, last line from include file to display

``start-line``, and ``end-line`` have the same meaning as in the
docutils ``include`` directive, that is, they index from zero.

Example
-------

./incfile.py:

.. code:: python

    # These two comment lines will not
    # be included in the output
    import random

    insults = ['I fart in your general direction',
               'your mother was a hampster',
               'your father smelt of elderberries']

    def insult():
        print random.choice(insults)
    # This comment line will be included
    # ...but this one won't

./yourfile.rst:

.. code:: rst

    How to Insult the English
    =========================

    :author: Pierre Devereaux

    A function to help insult those silly English knnnnnnniggets:

    .. code-include:: incfile.py
        :lexer: python
        :encoding: utf-8
        :tab-width: 4
        :start-line: 3
        :end-line: 11


# Creole Reader

This plugins allows you to write your posts using the wikicreole syntax. Give to
these files the creole extension. The metadata are between `<<header>> <</header>>`
tags.

## Dependency
This plugin relies on [python-creole](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-creole/) to work. Install it with:
`pip install python-creole`

## Syntax
Use ** for strong, // for emphasis, one = for 1st level titles. Please use the
following macro for code highlighting:
`<<code ext=".file_extension">> <</code>>`

For the complete syntax, look at: http://www.wikicreole.org/

## Basic example
```
<<header>>
title: Cr√©ole
tags: creole, python, pelican_open
date: 2013-12-12
<</header>>

= Title 1
== Title 2

Some nice text with **strong** and //emphasis//.

* A nice list
** With sub-elements
* Python

<<code ext=".py">>
print("Hello World")
<</code>>

# An ordered list
# A second item
```

#Custom Article URLs#

This plugin adds support for defining different default URLs for different
categories, or different subcategories if using the subcategory plugin.

##Usage##

After adding `custom_article_urls` to your `PLUGINS`, add a
`CUSTOM_ARTICLE_URLS` setting, which is a dictionary of rules. The rules are
also a dictionary, consisting of the `URL` and the `SAVE_AS` values.

For example, if you had two categories, *Category 1* and *Category 2*, and you
would like *Category 1* saved as `category-1/article-slug/` and *Category 2*
saved as `/year/month/article-slug/`, you would add:

    CUSTOM_ARTICLE_URLS = {
        'Category 1': {'URL': '{category}/{slug}/,
            'SAVE_AS': '{category}/{slug}/index.html},
        'Category 2': {'URL': '{date:%Y}/{date:%B}/{slug}/,
            'SAVE_AS': '{date:%Y}/{date:%B}/{slug}/index.html},
        }

If you had any other categories, they would use the default `ARTICLE_SAVE_AS`
and `ARTICLE_URL` settings.

If you are using the subcategory plugin, you can define them the same way.
For example, if *Category 1* had a subcategory called *Sub Category*, you could
define its rules with::

    'Category 1/Sub Category`: ...

##Other Usage: Article Metadata##

If you define `URL` and `Save_as` in your article metadata, then this plugin
will not alter that value. So you can still specify special one-off URLs as
you normally would.

Disqus static comment plugin for Pelican
====================================

This plugin adds a disqus_comments property to all articles.
Comments are fetched at generation time using disqus API.

Installation
------------
Because we use disqus API to retrieve the comments you need to create an application at
http://disqus.com/api/applications/ which will provide you with a secret and public keys for the API.

We use disqus-python package for communication with disqus API:
``pip install disqus-python``

Put ``disqus_static.py`` plugin in ``plugins`` folder in pelican installation 
and use the following in your settings::

    PLUGINS = [u"disqus_static"]

    DISQUS_SITENAME = u'YOUR_SITENAME'
    DISQUS_SECRET_KEY = u'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
    DISQUS_PUBLIC_KEY = u'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    {% if article.disqus_comments %}
    <div id="disqus_static_comments">
        <h4>{{ article.disqus_comment_count }} comments</h4>
        <ul class="post-list">
            {% for comment in article.disqus_comments recursive %}
            <li class="post">
                <div class="post-content">
                    <div class="avatar hovercard">
                        <img alt="Avatar" src="{{ comment.author.avatar.small.cache }}">
                    </div>
                    <div class="post-body">
                        <header>
                            <span class="publisher-anchor-color">{{ comment.author.name }}</span>
                            <span class="time-ago" title="{{ comment.createdAt }}">{{ comment.createdAt }}</span>
                        </header>
                        <div class="post-message-container">
                            <div class="post-message publisher-anchor-color ">
                                {{ comment.message }}
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                {% if comment.children %}
                <ul class="children">
                    {{ loop(comment.children) }}
                </ul>
                {% endif %}
            </li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    </div>
    {% endif %}

Extract Table of Content
========================

A Pelican plugin to extract table of contents (ToC) from `article.content` and
place it in its own `article.toc` variable.

Acknowledgement
---------------

Thanks to [Avaris](https://github.com/avaris) for going out of the way to help
me fix Unicode issues and doing a thorough code review.

Why do you need it?
===================

Pelican can generate ToC of reST and Markdown files, using markup's respective
directive and extension. ToC is generated and placed at the beginning of
`article.content`. You cannot place the ToC in `<nav>` HTML5 tag, nor can you
place the ToC at the end of your article's content because ToC is part of
`article.content`.

This plugin extracts ToC from `article.content` and places it in `article.toc`.

Requirements
============

`extract_toc` requires BeautifulSoup.

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

How to Use
==========

**Important!** This plugin only works with reST and Markdown files. reST files
should have `.rst` extension. Markdown files can have `.md`, `.mkd` or
`markdown`.

If ToC appears in your article at more than one places, `extract_toc` will
remove only the first occurrence. You shouldn't probably need to have multiple
ToC in your article. In case you need to display it multiple times, you can
print it via your template.

ToC generated by Markdown is enclosed in `<div class="toc">`. On the other hand
ToC generated by reST is enclosed in `<div class="contents topic">`.
`extract_toc` relies on this behavior to work.

reStructuredText Example
------------------------

To add a table of contents to your reStructuredText document you need to add a 'contents directive' at the place where you want the table of contents to appear. See the [documentation](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#table-of-contents) for more details.

```rst
My super title
##############

:date: 2010-10-03
:tags: thats, awesome

.. contents::
..
   1  Head 1
     1.1  Head 2
   2  Head 3
   3  head 4

Heading 1
---------

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aenean commodo ligula eget dolor. Aenean massa.
```

Markdown Example
----------------

To add a table of contents to your Markdown document you need to place the 'TOC marker' at the place where you would like the table of contents to appear. See the Python Markdown  [documentation](http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/toc.html) for more details.

Important! To enable table of contents generation for the markdown reader you need to set `MD_EXTENSIONS = (['toc'])` in your pelican configuration file.

```Markdown
title: My super title
date: 4-4-2013
tags: thats, awesome

[TOC]

# Heading 1 #

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aenean commodo ligula eget dolor. Aenean massa.
```

Template Example
================

```python
{% if article.toc %}
    <nav class="affix">
    {{ article.toc }}
    </nav>
{% endif %}
```

# Feed Summary #
This plugin allows article summaries to be used in ATOM and RSS feeds instead of the entire article. It uses the
built-in pelican `Summary:` metadata.

The summary of an article can either be set explicitly with the `Summary:` metadata attribute as described in the
[pelican getting started docs](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/getting_started.html#file-metadata),
or automatically generated using the number of words specified in the
[SUMMARY_MAX_LENGTH](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/settings.html) setting.

## Usage ##
To use this plugin, ensure the following are set in your `pelicanconf.py` file:

    PLUGIN_PATH = '/path/to/pelican-plugins'
    PLUGINS = [
		'feed_summary',
		]
    'FEED_USE_SUMMARY' = True

The default value of `'FEED_USE_SUMMARY'` is `False`, so it must be set to `True` to enable the plugin, even if it is loaded.

This plugin is written for pelican 3.3 and later.


## Implementation Notes ##

This plugin derives `FeedSummaryWriter` from the `Writer` class, duplicating code of the `Writer._add_item_to_the_feed` method.

When the `initialized` signal is sent, it alternates the `get_writer` method of the `Pelican` object to use `FeedSummaryWriter` instead of `Writer`.

A little hackish, but currently this can't be done otherwise via the regular plugin methods.

Gallery
==================

* Allows an article to contain an album of pictures.
* All albums can also be syndicated into a central gallery page.

##How to Use

1. Group images into folders, with each folder representing an album.
2. Place all album folders within a folder named gallery, which resides within the images folder.

		./content/images/gallery/album_name
	
###Articles

Attach an album to an article/post by placing a gallery metadata tag with the name of the album.

	gallery:album_name
    
The template has access to the album name.

	article.album

And the filename of images within an album.

	article.albumimages

###Gallery Page

Create a page and a gallery template (named gallery.html). And inform pelican to use the gallery template for the page.

	template:gallery
    
The template has access to a dictionary of lists.  
The dictionary key is the name of the album and the lists contain the filenames.

	page.gallery
	
##Examples

###article.html

	<h2><a href="{{ SITEURL }}/pages/gallery.html#{{ article.album }}">{{ article.album }}</a></h2>
	    <ul>
		{% for image in article.galleryimages %}
		<li><a class="{{ article.album }} cboxElement" href="{{ SITEURL }}/static/images/gallery/{{ article.album }}/{{ image }}"><img src="{{ SITEURL }}/static/images/gallery200x200/{{ article.album }}/{{ image }}"></a></li>
		{% endfor %}
	    </ul>
		
###gallery.html

	{% for album, images in page.gallery.iteritems() %}
	<h2><a name="{{ album }}">{{ album }}</a></h2>
	<ul>
	    {% for image in images %}
	    <li><a class="{{ album }} cboxElement" href="{{ SITEURL }}/static/images/gallery/{{album}}/{{ image }}" title="{{ image }}"><img src="{{ SITEURL }}/static/images/gallery200x200/{{album}}/{{ image }}"></a></li>
	    {% endfor %}
	</ul>
	{% endfor %}

###posts/foo.md

	title:Foo
	gallery:albumname
	
###pages/gallery.md

	title:All Images
	template:gallery
	
##Reasoning

The album name and filenames are returned as opposed to the direct path to the images,
to allow flexibility of different thumbnail sizes to be used it different locations of a website.

	href="{{ SITEURL }}/static/images/gallery/{{album}}/{{ image }}"
	href="{{ SITEURL }}/static/images/gallery200x200/{{album}}/{{ image }}"
	
It also allows a thumbnail to link to the full image,
as well as the filename extension to be stripped and the title of an image to be displayed along side the title of an album.

##Recommendation

It is recommended to use this extension along with the thumbnailer plugin.

	RESIZE = [
            ('gallery', False, 200,200),
          ]

You may also wish to use this along with a gallery plugin such as [Colorbox](http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/).

##In Use

* [SESIF Article](http://sesif.github.io/my-super-title.html)
* [SESIF Gallery](http://sesif.github.io/pages/gallery.html)
* [SESIF Source](http://github.com/SESIF/SESIF.github.io/tree/source)

GitHub activity
---------------

This plugin makes use of the `feedparser`_ library that you'll need to
install.

Set the ``GITHUB_ACTIVITY_FEED`` parameter to your GitHub activity feed.
For example, to track Pelican project activity, the setting would be::

     GITHUB_ACTIVITY_FEED = 'https://github.com/getpelican.atom'

If you want to limit the amount of entries to a certain maximum set the
``GITHUB_ACTIVITY_MAX_ENTRIES`` parameter.

     GITHUB_ACTIVITY_MAX_ENTRIES = 10

On the template side, you just have to iterate over the ``github_activity``
variable, as in this example::

     {% if GITHUB_ACTIVITY_FEED %}
        <div class="social">
                <h2>Github Activity</h2>
                <ul>

                {% for entry in github_activity %}
                    <li><b>{{ entry[0] }}</b><br /> {{ entry[1] }}</li>
                {% endfor %}
                </ul>
        </div><!-- /.github_activity -->
     {% endif %}

``github_activity`` is a list of lists. The first element is the title,
and the second element is the raw HTML from GitHub.

Global license
--------------

This plugin allows you to define a ``LICENSE`` setting and adds the contents of that
license variable to the article's context, making that variable available to use
from within your theme's templates.

### Credits

This plugin is inspired by Marco Milanesi <kpanic@gnufunk.org> Github activity plugin.

Requirements
============

`goodreads_activity` requires feedparser.

```bash
pip install feedparser
```

How to Use
==========

**Important** Unlike Marco's Github activity plugin, this plugin returns
a dictionary composed of the books in your Goodreads shelf and their
details.

To enable it, set `GOODREADS_ACTIVITY_FEED` in your pelican config file. It should point to the activity feed of your bookshelf.

To find your self's activity feed,

1.  Open Goodreads homepage and login
2.  Click on My Books in the top navigational bar
3.  Select the bookshelf you are interested in from the left hand column
4.  Look for RSS link in the footer. Copy it's link.

Here is an example feed of currently-reading shelf,

```python
GOODREADS_ACTIVITY_FEED='http://www.goodreads.com/review/list_rss/8028663?key=b025l3000336epw1pix047e853agggannc9932ed&shelf=currently-reading'
```

You can access the `goodreads_activity` in your Jinja2 template. `goodreads_activity` is a dictionary. Its valid keys are

1.  `shelf_title` it has the title of your shelf
2.  `books` it is an array of book dictionary

Valid keys for `book` dictionary are

1.  `title`
2.  `author`
3.  `link` link to your book review
4.  `l_cover` large cover
5.  `m_cover` medium cover
6.  `s_cover` small cover
7.  `description`
8.  `rating`
9.  `review`
10. `tags`

Template Example
================

```python
{% if GOODREADS_ACTIVITY_FEED %}
    <h2>{{ goodreads_activity.shelf_title }}</h2>
    {% for book in goodreads_activity.books %}
        <img src="{{book.s_cover}}"/>
        <header>{{book.title}}<small> by {{book.author}}</small></header>
        <article>{{book.description|truncate(end='')}}
        <a href={{book.link}} target="_blank">...more</a></article>
    {% endfor %}
{% endif %}
```

GooglePlus Comments Plugin For Pelican
==================================

Adds GooglePlus comments to Pelican

Add the plugin to `pelicanconf.py`:

    PLUGIN_PATH = 'pelican-plugins'
    PLUGINS = ["googleplus_comments"]

Add a `<div>` for comments to the `article.html` of your template:

    <div id="commentswrap">
    <div id="comments"></div>
    </div>
    {{ article.metadata.googleplus_comments }}

See it working, and ask for support:

<http://zonca.github.io/2013/09/google-plus-comments-plugin-for-pelican.html>

Gravatar
--------

This plugin assigns the ``author_gravatar`` variable to the Gravatar URL and
makes the variable available within the article's context. You can add
``AUTHOR_EMAIL`` to your settings file to define the default author's email
address. Obviously, that email address must be associated with a Gravatar
account.

Alternatively, you can provide an email address from within article metadata.

In ReSTructuredText::

    :email:  john.doe@example.com

In Markdown::

    Email:  john.doe@example.com

If the email address is defined via at least one of the two methods above, the
``author_gravatar`` variable is added to the article's context. For markdown,
it is critical the 'E' in Email is capitalized.


Gzip cache
----------

Certain web servers (e.g., Nginx) can use a static cache of gzip-compressed
files to prevent the server from compressing files during an HTTP call. Since
compression occurs at another time, these compressed files can be compressed
at a higher compression level for increased optimization.

The ``gzip_cache`` plugin compresses all common text type files into a ``.gz``
file within the same directory as the original file.

======================
 I18N Sub-sites Plugin
======================

This plugin extends the translations functionality by creating internationalized sub-sites for the default site. It is therefore redundant with the *\*_LANG_{SAVE_AS,URL}* variables, so it disables them to prevent conflicts.

What it does
============
1. The *\*_LANG_URL* and *\*_LANG_SAVE_AS* variables are set to their normal counterparts (e.g. *ARTICLE_URL*) so they don't conflict with this scheme.
2. While building the site for *DEFAULT_LANG* the translations of pages and articles are not generated, but their relations to the original content is kept via links to them.
3. For each non-default language a "sub-site" with a modified config [#conf]_ is created [#run]_, linking the translations to the originals (if available). The configured language code is appended to the *OUTPUT_PATH* and *SITEURL* of each sub-site. For each sub-site, *DEFAULT_LANG* is changed to the language of the sub-site so that articles in a different language are treated as translations.

If *HIDE_UNTRANSLATED_CONTENT* is True (default), content without a translation for a language is generated as hidden (for pages) or draft (for articles) for the corresponding language sub-site.

.. [#conf] For each language a config override is given in the *I18N_SUBSITES* dictionary.
.. [#run] Using a new *PELICAN_CLASS* instance and its ``run`` method, so each sub-site could even have a different *PELICAN_CLASS* if specified in *I18N_SUBSITES* conf overrides.

Setting it up
=============

For each extra used language code, a language-specific variables overrides dictionary must be given (but can be empty) in the *I18N_SUBSITES* dictionary

.. code-block:: python

    PLUGINS = ['i18n_subsites', ...]

    # mapping: language_code -> conf_overrides_dict
    I18N_SUBSITES = {
        'cz': {
	    'SITENAME': 'Hezkej blog',
	    }
	}

- The language code is the language identifier used in the *lang* metadata. It is appended to *OUTPUT_PATH* and *SITEURL* of each I18N sub-site.
- The internationalized config overrides dictionary may specify configuration variable overrides ‚Äî e.g. a different *LOCALE*, *SITENAME*, *TIMEZONE*, etc. However, it **must not** override *OUTPUT_PATH* and *SITEURL* as they are modified automatically by appending the language code.

Localizing templates
--------------------

Most importantly, this plugin can use localized templates for each sub-site. There are two approaches to having the templates localized:

- You can set a different *THEME* override for each language in *I18N_SUBSITES*, e.g. by making a copy of a theme ``my_theme`` to ``my_theme_lang`` and then editing the templates in the new localized theme. This approach means you don't have to deal with gettext ``*.po`` files, but it is harder to maintain over time.
- You use only one theme and localize the templates using the `jinja2.ext.i18n Jinja2 extension <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#i18n>`_. For a kickstart read this `guide <./localizing_using_jinja2.rst>`_.

It may be convenient to add language buttons to your theme in addition to the translation links of articles and pages. These buttons could, for example, point to the *SITEURL* of each (sub-)site. For this reason the plugin adds these variables to the template context:

main_lang
  The language of the top-level site ‚Äî the original *DEFAULT_LANG*
main_siteurl
  The *SITEURL* of the top-level site ‚Äî the original *SITEURL*
lang_siteurls
  An ordered dictionary, mapping all used languages to their *SITEURL*. The ``main_lang`` is the first key with ``main_siteurl`` as the value. This dictionary is useful for implementing global language buttons that show the language of the currently viewed (sub-)site too.
extra_siteurls
  An ordered dictionary, subset of ``lang_siteurls``, the current *DEFAULT_LANG* of the rendered (sub-)site is not included, so for each (sub-)site ``set(extra_siteurls) == set(lang_siteurls) - set([DEFAULT_LANG])``. This dictionary is useful for implementing global language buttons that do not show the current language.

If you don't like the default ordering of the ordered dictionaries, use a Jinja2 filter to alter the ordering.

This short `howto <./implementing_language_buttons.rst>`_ shows two example implementations of language buttons.

Usage notes
===========
- It is **mandatory** to specify *lang* metadata for each article and page as *DEFAULT_LANG* is later changed for each sub-site, so content without *lang* metadata woudl be rendered in every (sub-)site.
- As with the original translations functionality, *slug* metadata is used to group translations. It is therefore often convenient to compensate for this by overriding the content URL (which defaults to slug) using the *URL* and *Save_as* metadata.

Future plans
============

- add a test suite

Development
===========

- A demo and test site is in the ``gh-pages`` branch and can be seen at http://smartass101.github.io/pelican-plugins/

ical
----

This plugin looks for and parses an ``.ics`` file if it is defined in a given
page's ``calendar`` metadata. One calendar can be defined per page.

Dependencies
------------

This plugin depends on the ``icalendar`` package, which can be installed via
pip::

	pip install icalendar

Usage
-----

For a reST-formatted page, include the following line in the metadata::

    :calendar: /path/to/your/ics/file

For Markdown, include the following line in the page metadata::

    Calendar: /path/to/your/ics/file

Following is some example code that can be added to your theme's ``page.html``
template in order to display the calendar::

    {% if page.calendar %}
    <dl>
        {% for vevent in events[page.slug] %}
            <dt>{{ vevent.summary }}</dt>
            <dd>{{ vevent.description|replace('\n\n', '<br>') }}</dd>
            <dd>{{ vevent.dtstart }}</dd>
            <dd>{{ vevent.dtend }}</dd>
            <dd class="footer"><a href="{{ vevent.url }}">See more</a></dd>
        {% endfor %}
    </dl>
    {% endif %}

Interlinks
=========================

This plugin lets you add frequently used URLs to your markup using short keywords. Short URL format is 
``keyword>rest-of-url`` where ``keyword`` is defined in the settings.py. Later it is replaced with acutal URL in
the generated HTML output.


Requirements
--------------------
``interlinks`` requires BeautifulSoup

	pip install beautifulsoup4

Installation
--------------------

Install the plugin normally (plugins folder), then add interlinks in the settings.py:

	PLUGINS = ["interlinks"]
	
Usage
------------------

The interlinks are specified in the settings.py file as (example):

	INTERLINKS = {
	    'wikipedia_en': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/',
	    'wikipedia_es': 'http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/',
	    'ddg': 'https://duckduckgo.com/?q='
	}

There's also a default key, ``this``, that is mapped to the ``SITEURL`` variable.

Then, in a blog post, you just create a normal link but adding the ``keyword>`` syntax in the url specification, followed by the rest of the url. 

Example 
-------------------
(markdown syntax)

	[Normal boring link](http://www.example.com). But this is a [cool link](this>) that links to this site.

	Search in [Wikipedia](wikipedia_en>python), ([here](wikipedia_es>python) in spanish). Also can [search](ddg>python) it.

All the above will be rendered as: 

	<p><a href="http://www.example.com">Normal boring link</a>. But this is a <a href="http://[yoursite]/index.html">cool link</a> that links to this site.</p>
	
	<p>Search in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/python">Wikipedia</a>, (<a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/python">here</a> in spanish). Also can <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=python">search</a> it.</p>

# Liquid-style Tags
*Author: Jake Vanderplas <jakevdp@cs.washington.edu>*

This plugin allows liquid-style tags to be inserted into markdown within
Pelican documents. Liquid uses tags bounded by ``{% ... %}``, and is used
to extend markdown in other blogging platforms such as octopress.

This set of extensions does not actually interface with liquid, but allows
users to define their own liquid-style tags which will be inserted into
the markdown preprocessor stream.  There are several built-in tags, which
can be added as follows.

First, in your pelicanconf.py file, add the plugins you want to  use:

    PLUGIN_PATH = '/path/to/pelican-plugins'
    PLUGINS = ['liquid_tags.img', 'liquid_tags.video',
               'liquid_tags.youtube', 'liquid_tags.vimeo',
               'liquid_tags.include_code', 'liquid_tags.notebook']

There are several options available

## Image Tag
To insert a sized and labeled image in your document, enable the
``liquid_tags.img`` plugin and use the following:

    {% img [class name(s)] path/to/image [width [height]] [title text | "title text" ["alt text"]] %}

## Youtube Tag
To insert youtube video into a post, enable the
``liquid_tags.youtube`` plugin, and add to your document:

    {% youtube youtube_id [width] [height] %}

The width and height are in pixels, and can be optionally specified.  If they
are not, then the dimensions will be 640 (wide) by 390 (tall).

## Vimeo Tag
To insert a Vimeo video into a post, enable the
``liquid_tags.vimeo`` plugin, and add to your document:

    {% vimeo vimeo_id [width] [height] %}

The width and height are in pixels, and can be optionally specified.  If they
are not, then the dimensions will be 640 (wide) by 390 (tall).

## Video Tag
To insert flash/HTML5-friendly video into a post, enable the
``liquid_tags.video`` plugin, and add to your document:

    {% video /url/to/video.mp4 [width] [height] [/path/to/poster.png] %}

The width and height are in pixels, and can be optionally specified.  If they
are not, then the original video size will be used.  The poster is an image
which is used as a preview of the video.

To use a video from file, make sure it's in a static directory and put in
the appropriate url.

## Include Code
To include code from a file in your document with a link to the original
file, enable the ``liquid_tags.include_code`` plugin, and add to your
document:

    {% include_code /path/to/code.py [lang:python] [lines:X-Y] [:hidefilename:] [title] %}

All arguments are optional but their order must be kept. `:hidefilename:` is
only allowed if a title is also given.

    {% include_code /path/to/code.py lines:1-10 :hidefilename: Test Example %}

This example will show the first 10 lines of the file while hiding the actual
filename.

The script must be in the ``code`` subdirectory of your content folder:
this default location can be changed by specifying

   CODE_DIR = 'code'

within your configuration file. Additionally, in order for the resulting
hyperlink to work, this directory must be listed under the STATIC_PATHS
setting, e.g.:

    STATIC_PATHS = ['images', 'code']

## IPython notebooks
To insert an ipython notebook into your post, enable the
``liquid_tags.notebook`` plugin and add to your document:

    {% notebook filename.ipynb %}

The file should be specified relative to the ``notebooks`` subdirectory of the
content directory.  Optionally, this subdirectory can be specified in the
config file:

    NOTEBOOK_DIR = 'notebooks'

Because the conversion and rendering of notebooks is rather involved, there
are a few extra steps required for this plugin:

- First, you will need to install IPython >= 1.0 [1]_

- After typing "make html" when using the notebook tag, a file called
  ``_nb_header.html`` will be produced in the main directory.  The content
  of the file should be included in the header of the theme.  An easy way
  to accomplish this is to add the following lines within the header template
  of the theme you use:

      {% if EXTRA_HEADER %}
      {{ EXTRA_HEADER }}
      {% endif %}

  and in your configuration file, include the line:

      EXTRA_HEADER = open('_nb_header.html').read().decode('utf-8')

  this will insert the proper css formatting into your document.

### Collapsible Code in IPython Notebooks

The plugin also enables collapsible code input boxes. For this to work
you first need to copy the file ``pelicanhtml_1.tpl`` (for IPython
1.x) ``pelicanhtml_2.tpl`` (for IPython 2.x) to the top level of your
Pelican blog. Notebook input cells containing the comment line ``#
<!-- collapse=True -->`` will be collapsed when the html page is
loaded and can be expanded by clicking on them. Cells containing the
comment line ``# <!-- collapse=False -->`` will be open on load but
can be collapsed by clicking on their header. Cells without collapse
comments are rendered as standard code input cells.

Multi parts posts
-----------------

The multi-part posts plugin allow you to write multi-part posts.

In order to mark posts as part of a multi-part post, use the `:parts:` metadata:

    :parts:  MY_AWESOME_MULTI_PART_POST

You can then use the `article.metadata.parts_articles` variable in your templates 
to display other parts of current post.

For example:

    {% if article.metadata.parts_articles %}
        <p>This post is part of a series:</p>
        <ol class="parts">
            {% for part_article in article.metadata.parts_articles %}
                <li {% if part_article == article %}class="active"{% endif %}>
                    <a href='{{ SITEURL }}/{{ part_article.url }}'>{{ part_article.title }}</a>
                </li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ol>
    {% endif %}

Neighbor Articles Plugin for Pelican
====================================

This plugin adds ``next_article`` (newer) and ``prev_article`` (older) 
variables to the article's context.

Also adds ``next_article_in_category`` and ``prev_article_in_category``.


Usage
-----

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    <ul>
    {% if article.prev_article %}
        <li>
            <a href="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ article.prev_article.url}}">
                {{ article.prev_article.title }}
            </a>
        </li>
    {% endif %}
    {% if article.next_article %}
        <li>
            <a href="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ article.next_article.url}}">
                {{ article.next_article.title }}
            </a>
        </li>
    {% endif %}
   </ul>    
   <ul>
    {% if article.prev_article_in_category %}
        <li>
            <a href="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ article.prev_article_in_category.url}}">
                {{ article.prev_article_in_category.title }}
            </a>
        </li>
    {% endif %}
    {% if article.next_article %}
        <li>
            <a href="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ article.next_article_in_category.url}}">
                {{ article.next_article_in_category.title }}
            </a>
        </li>
    {% endif %}
    </ul> 

Usage with the Subcategory plugin
---------------------------------

If you want to get the neigbors within a subcategory it's a little different.
Since an article can belong to more than one subcategory, subcategories are
stored in a list. If you have an article with subcategories like 

``Category/Foo/Bar``

it will belong to both subcategory Foo, and Foo/Bar. Subcategory neighbors are
added to an article as ``next_article_in_subcategory#`` and 
``prev_article_in_subcategory#`` where ``#`` is the level of subcategory. So using
the example from above, subcategory1 will be Foo, and subcategory2 Foo/Bar. 
Therefor the usage with subcategories is:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    <ul>
    {% if article.prev_article_subcategory1 %}
        <li>
            <a href="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ article.prev_article_in_subcategory1.url}}">
                {{ article.prev_article_in_subcategory1.title }}
            </a>
        </li>
    {% endif %}
    {% if article.next_article %}
        <li>
            <a href="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ article.next_article_subcategory1.url}}">
                {{ article.next_article_subcategory1.title }}
            </a>
        </li>
    {% endif %}
   </ul>    
   <ul>
    {% if article.prev_article_in_subcategory2 %}
        <li>
            <a href="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ article.prev_article_in_subcategory2.url}}">
                {{ article.prev_article_in_subcategory2.title }}
            </a>
        </li>
    {% endif %}
    {% if article.next_article %}
        <li>
            <a href="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ article.next_article_in_subcategory2.url}}">
                {{ article.next_article_in_subcategory2.title }}
            </a>
        </li>
    {% endif %}
    </ul> 


Optimize Images Plugin For Pelican
==================================

This plugin applies lossless compression on JPEG and PNG images, with no
effect on image quality. It uses [jpegtran][1] and [OptiPNG][2]. It assumes
that both of these tools are installed on system path.

[1]: http://jpegclub.org/jpegtran/              "jpegtran"
[2]: http://optipng.sourceforge.net/            "OptiPNG"


Installation
------------

To enable, ensure that `optimize_images.py` is put somewhere that is accessible.
Then use as follows by adding the following to your settings.py:

    PLUGIN_PATH = 'path/to/pelican-plugins'
    PLUGINS = ["optimize_images"]

`PLUGIN_PATH` can be a path relative to your settings file or an absolute path.

Usage
-----
The plugin will activate and optimize images upon `finalized` signal of
pelican.

PDF Generator
-------------

The PDF Generator plugin automatically exports RST articles and pages
as PDF files as part of the site-generation process. PDFs are saved to
output/pdf/

# Avatars and Identicons
To activate the avatars and [identicons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon) you have to set `PELICAN_COMMENT_SYSTEM_IDENTICON_DATA`.

##### Example
```python
PELICAN_COMMENT_SYSTEM_IDENTICON_DATA = ('author')
```
Now every comment with the same author tag will be treated as if written from the same person. And therefore have the same avatar/identicon. Of cause you can modify this tuple so other metadata are checked.

## Specific Avatars
To set a specific avatar for a author you have to add them to the `PELICAN_COMMENT_SYSTEM_AUTHORS` dictionary.

The `key` of the dictionary has to be a tuple of the form of `PELICAN_COMMENT_SYSTEM_IDENTICON_DATA`, so in our case only the author's name.

The `value` of the dictionary is the path to the specific avatar.

##### Example
```python
PELICAN_COMMENT_SYSTEM_AUTHORS = {
	('John'): "images/authors/john.png",
	('Tom'): "images/authors/tom.png",
}
```

## Theme
To display the avatars and identicons simply add the following in the "comment for loop" in your theme:

```html
<img src="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ comment.avatar }}"
		alt="Avatar"
		height="{{ PELICAN_COMMENT_SYSTEM_IDENTICON_SIZE }}"
		width="{{ PELICAN_COMMENT_SYSTEM_IDENTICON_SIZE }}">
```

Of cause the `height` and `width` are optional, but they make sure that everything has the same size (in particular  specific avatars).

# Comment Atom Feed
## Custom comment url
Be sure that the id of the html tag containing the comment matches `COMMENT_URL`.

##### pelicanconf.py
```python
COMMENT_URL = "#my_own_comment_id_{path}"
```

##### Theme
```html
{% for comment in article.comments recursive %}
	...
	<article id="my_own_comment_id_{{comment.id}}">{{ comment.content }}</article>
	...
{% endfor %}
```
## Theme
#### Link
To display a link to the article feed simply add the following to your theme:

```html
{% if article %}
	<a href="{{ FEED_DOMAIN }}/{{ PELICAN_COMMENT_SYSTEM_FEED|format(article.slug) }}">Comment Atom Feed</a>
{% endif %}
```



# Comment Form (aka: never gather Metadata)
Add a form, which allows your visitors to easily write comments.

But more importantly, on submit the form generates a mailto-link.
The resulting email contains a valid markdown block. Now you only have to copy this block in a new file. And therefore there is no need to gather the metadata (like date, author, replyto) yourself.

#### Reply button
Add this in the "comment for loop" in your article theme, so your visitors can reply to a comment.

```html
<button onclick="reply('{{comment.id | urlencode}}');">Reply</button>
```

#### Form
A basic form so your visitors can write comments.

```html
<form role="form" id="commentForm" action="#">
	<input name="Name" type="text" id="commentForm_inputName" placeholder="Enter your name or synonym">
	<textarea name="Text" id="commentForm_inputText" rows="10" style="resize:vertical;" placeholder="Your comment"></textarea>
	<button type="submit" id="commentForm_button">Post via email</button>
	<input name="replyto" type="hidden" id="commentForm_replyto">
</form>
```
You may want to add a button to reset the `replyto` field.

#### Javascript
To generate the mailto-Link and set the `replyto` field there is some javascript required.

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
	function reply(id)
	{
		id = decodeURIComponent(id);
		$('#commentForm_replyto').val(id);
	}

	$(document).ready(function() {
		function generateMailToLink()
		{
			var user = 'your_user_name'; //user@domain = your email address
			var domain = 'your_email_provider';
			var subject = 'Comment for \'{{ article.slug }}\'' ;

			var d = new Date();
			var body = ''
				+ 'Hey,\nI posted a new comment on ' + document.URL + '\n\nGreetings ' + $("#commentForm_inputName").val() + '\n\n\n'
				+ 'Raw comment data:\n'
				+ '----------------------------------------\n'
				+ 'date: ' + d.getFullYear() + '-' + (d.getMonth()+1) + '-' + d.getDate() + ' ' + d.getHours() + ':' + d.getMinutes() + '\n'
				+ 'author: ' + $("#commentForm_inputName").val() + '\n';

			var replyto = $('#commentForm_replyto').val();
			if (replyto.length != 0)
			{
				body += 'replyto: ' + replyto + '\n'
			}

			body += '\n'
				+ $("#commentForm_inputText").val() + '\n'
				+ '----------------------------------------\n';

			var link = 'mailto:' + user + '@' + domain + '?subject='
				+ encodeURIComponent(subject)
				+ "&body="
				+ encodeURIComponent(body);
			return link;
		}


		$('#commentForm').on("submit",
			function( event )
			{
				event.preventDefault();
				$(location).attr('href', generateMailToLink());
			}
		);
	});
</script>
```
(jQuery is required for this script)

Don't forget to set the Variables `user` and `domain`.

# Installation
Activate the plugin by adding it to your `pelicanconf.py`

	PLUGIN_PATH = '/path/to/pelican-plugins'
	PLUGINS = ['pelican_comment_system']
	PELICAN_COMMENT_SYSTEM = True

And modify your `article.html` theme (see below).

## Settings
Name                                           | Type      | Default                    | Description
-----------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------|-------
`PELICAN_COMMENT_SYSTEM`                       | `boolean` | `False`                    | Activates or deactivates the comment system
`PELICAN_COMMENT_SYSTEM_DIR`                   | `string`  | `comments`                 | Folder where the comments are stored
`PELICAN_COMMENT_SYSTEM_IDENTICON_OUTPUT_PATH` | `string`  | `images/identicon`         | Relative URL to the output folder where the identicons are stored
`PELICAN_COMMENT_SYSTEM_IDENTICON_DATA`        | `tuple`   | `()`                       | Contains all Metadata tags, which in combination identifies a comment author (like `('author', 'email')`)
`PELICAN_COMMENT_SYSTEM_IDENTICON_SIZE`        | `int`     | `72`                       | Width and height of the identicons. Has to be a multiple of 3.
`PELICAN_COMMENT_SYSTEM_AUTHORS`               | `dict`    | `{}`                       | Comment authors, which should have a specific avatar. More info [here](avatars.md)
`PELICAN_COMMENT_SYSTEM_FEED`                  | `string`  |`feeds/comment.%s.atom.xml` | Relative URL to output the Atom feed for each article.`%s` gets replaced with the slug of the article. More info [here](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/settings.html#feed-settings)
`COMMENT_URL`                                  | `string`  | `#comment-{path}`          | `{path}` gets replaced with the id of the comment. More info [here](feed.md)

## Folder structure
Every comment file has to be stored in a sub folder of `PELICAN_COMMENT_SYSTEM_DIR`.
Sub folders are named after the `slug` of the articles.

So the comments to your `foo-bar` article are stored in `comments/foo-bar/`

The filenames of the comment files are up to you. But the filename is the Identifier of the comment (**with** extension).

##### Example folder structure

	.
	‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ comments
		‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ foo-bar
		‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1.md
		‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 0.md
		‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ some-other-slug
			‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ random-Name.md
			‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1.md
			‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 0.md


## Comment file
### Meta information
Tag           | Required  | Description
--------------|-----------|----------------
`date`        | yes       | Date when the comment was posted
`author`      | yes       | Name of the comment author
`replyto`     | no        | Identifier of the parent comment. Identifier = Filename (**with** extension)

Every other (custom) tag gets parsed as well and will be available through the theme.

##### Example of a comment file

	date: 2014-3-21 15:02
	author: Author of the comment
	website: http://authors.website.com
	replyto: 7
	anothermetatag: some random tag

	Content of the comment.

## Theme
In the `article.html` theme file are now two more variables available.

Variables                | Description
-------------------------|--------------------------
`article.comments_count` | Amount of total comments for this article (including replies to comments)
`article.comments`       | Array containing the top level comments for this article (no replies to comments)

### Comment object
The comment object is a [content](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/blob/master/pelican/contents.py#L34) object, so all common attributes are available (like author, content, date, local_date, metadata, ...).

Additional following attributes are added:

Attribute  | Description
-----------|--------------------------
`id`       | Identifier of this comment
`replies`  | Array containing the top level replies for this comment
`avatar`   | Path to the avatar or identicon of the comment author

```html
{% if article.comments %}
	{% for comment in article.comments recursive %}
		{% if loop.depth0 == 0 %}
			{% set marginLeft = 0 %}
		{% else %}
			{% set marginLeft = 50 %}
		{% endif %}
			<article id="comment-{{comment.id}}" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD; padding: 5px 0px 0px 5px; margin: 0px -1px 5px {{marginLeft}}px;">
				<a href="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ article.url }}#comment-{{comment.id}}" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to this comment">Permalink</a>

# Pelican comment system
The pelican comment system allows you to add static comments to your articles.
The comments are stored in Markdown files. Each comment in it own file.

#### Features
 - Static comments for each article
 - Replies to comments
 - Avatars and [Identicons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon)
 - Comment Atom Feed for each article
 - Easy styleable via the themes


See it in action here: [blog.scheirle.de](http://blog.scheirle.de/posts/2014/March/29/static-comments-via-email/)

## Instructions
 - [Installation and basic usage](doc/installation.md)
 - [Avatars and Identicons](doc/avatars.md)
 - [Comment Atom Feed](doc/feed.md)
 - [Comment Form (aka: never gather Metadata)](doc/form.md)
 
## Requirements
To create identicons the Python Image Library is needed. Therefore you either need PIL **or** Pillow (recommended).

##### Install Pillow
	easy_install Pillow
	
If you don't use avatars or identicons this plugin works fine without PIL/Pillow. You will however get a warning that identicons are deactivated (as expected).

Post Statistics
==================

A Pelican plugin to calculate various statistics about a post and store them in an article.stats dictionary:

- ``wc``: how many words
- ``read_mins``: how many minutes would it take to read this article, based on 250 wpm (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_per_minute#Reading_and_comprehension)
- ``word_counts``: frquency count of all the words in the article; can be used for tag/word clouds
- ``fi``: Flesch-kincaid Index/ Reading Ease (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests)
- ``fk``: Flesch-kincaid Grade Level

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    {
        'wc': 2760,
        'fi': '65.94',
        'fk': '7.65',
        'word_counts': Counter({u'to': 98, u'a': 90, u'the': 83, u'of': 50, ...}),
        'read_mins': 12
    }

This allows you to output these values in your templates, like this, for example:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

	<p title="~{{ article.stats['wc'] }} words">~{{ article.stats['read_mins'] }} min read</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>Flesch-kincaid Index/ Reading Ease: {{ article.stats['fi'] }}</li>
	    <li>Flesch-kincaid Grade Level: {{ article.stats['fk'] }}</li>
	</ul>

The ``word_counts`` variable is a python ``Counter`` dictionary and looks something like this, with each unique word and it's frequency:

.. code-block:: python

	Counter({u'to': 98, u'a': 90, u'the': 83, u'of': 50, u'karma': 50, .....

and can be used to create a tag/word cloud for a post.

Requirements
----------------

`post_stats` requires BeautifulSoup.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install beautifulsoup4

Random Article Plugin For Pelican
========================

This plugin generates a html file which redirect to a random article
using javascript's `window.location`. The generated html file is 
saved at `SITEURL`.

Only published articles are listed to redirect.

Usage
-----

To use it you have to add in your config file the name of the file to use:

    RANDOM = 'random.html'

Then in some template you add:

    <a href="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ RANDOM }}">random article</a>

Pelican Plugins
###############

Beginning with version 3.0, Pelican supports plugins. Plugins are a way to add
features to Pelican without having to directly modify the Pelican core. Starting
with 3.2, all plugins (including the ones previously in the core) are 
moved here, so this is the central place for all plugins. 

How to use plugins
==================

Easiest way to install and use these plugins is cloning this repo::

    git clone https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins

and activating the ones you want in your settings file::

    PLUGIN_PATH = 'path/to/pelican-plugins'
    PLUGINS = ['assets', 'sitemap', 'gravatar']

``PLUGIN_PATH`` can be a path relative to your settings file or an absolute path.

Alternatively, if plugins are in an importable path, you can omit ``PLUGIN_PATH``
and list them::

    PLUGINS = ['assets', 'sitemap', 'gravatar']

or you can ``import`` the plugin directly and give that::

    import my_plugin
    PLUGINS = [my_plugin, 'assets']

Please refer to the ``Readme`` file in a plugin's folder for detailed information about 
that plugin.

Contributing a plugin
=====================

Please refer to the `Contributing`_ file.

.. _Contributing: Contributing.rst

Read More Link
===

**Author**: Vuong Nguyen (http://vuongnguyen.com)

This plugin inserts an inline "read more" or "continue" link into the last html element of the object summary.

For more information, please visit: http://vuongnguyen.com/creating-inline-read-more-link-python-pelican-lxml.html

Requirements
---

    lxml - for parsing html elements

Settings
---
    # This settings indicates that you want to create summary at a certain length
    SUMMARY_MAX_LENGTH = 50

    # This indicates what goes inside the read more link
    READ_MORE_LINK = None (ex: '<span>continue</span>')

    # This is the format of the read more link
    READ_MORE_LINK_FORMAT = '<a class="read-more" href="/{url}">{text}</a>'



Related posts
-------------

This plugin adds the ``related_posts`` variable to the article's context.
By default, up to 5 articles are listed. You can customize this value by 
defining ``RELATED_POSTS_MAX`` in your settings file::

    RELATED_POSTS_MAX = 10

You can then use the ``article.related_posts`` variable in your templates.
For example::

    {% if article.related_posts %}
        <ul>
        {% for related_post in article.related_posts %}
            <li><a href="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ related_post.url }}">{{ related_post.title }}</a></li>
        {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    {% endif %}


Your related posts should share a common tag. You can also use ``related_posts:`` in your post's meta data.
The 'related_posts:' meta data works together with your existing slugs:

    related_posts: slug1,slug2,slug3...slugN 

N represents the RELATED_POSTS_MAX

Math Render Plugin For Pelican
==============================
This plugin gives pelican the ability to render mathematics. It accomplishes
this by using the [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) javascript engine. Both
[LaTex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) and [MathML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathML) 
can be rendered within the content.

The plugin also ensures that pelican and recognized math "play" nicely together, by
ensuring [Typogrify](https://github.com/mintchaos/typogrify) does not alter math content
and summaries that get cut off are repaired.

Recognized math in the context of this plugin is either LaTex or MathML as described below.

### LaTex
Anything between `$`...`$` (inline math) and `$$`..`$$` (displayed math) will be recognized as
LaTex. In addition, anything the `\begin` and `\end` LaTex macros will also be 
recognized as LaTex. For example, `\begin{equation}`...`\end{equation}` would be used to 
render math equations with numbering.

Within recognized LaTex as described above, any supported LaTex macro can be used.

### MathML
Anything between `<math>` and `</math>` tags will be recognized as MathML

Installation
------------
To enable, ensure that `render_math` plugin is accessible.
Then add the following to settings.py:

    PLUGINS = ["render_math"]

Your site is now capable of rendering math math using the mathjax JavaScript
engine. No alterations to the template is needed, just use and enjoy!

### Typogrify
In the past, using [Typgogrify](https://github.com/mintchaos/typogrify) would alter the math contents resulting
in math that could not be rendered by MathJax. The only option was to ensure
that Typogrify was disabled in the settings.

The problem has been recitified in this plugin, but it requires [Typogrify version 2.04](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/typogrify)
(or higher). If this version of Typogrify is not present, the plugin will inform that an incorrect
version of Typogrify is not present and disable Typogrify for the entire site

Usage
-----
### Backward Compatibility
This plugin is backward compatible in the sense that it
will render previous setups correctly. This is because those
settings and metadata information is ignored by this version. Therefore
you can remove them to neaten up your site

### Templates
No alteration is needed to a template for this plugin to work. Just install
the plugin and start writing your Math. 

If on the other hand, you are template designer and want total control
over the MathJax JavaScript, you can set the `auto_insert` setting to 
`False` which will cause no MathJax JavaScript to be added to the content.

If you choose this option, you should really know what you are doing. Therefore
only do this if you are designing your template. There is no real advantage to
to letting template logic handle the insertion of the MathJax JavaScript other
than it being slightly neater.

By setting `auto_insert` to `False`, metadata with `key` value of `mathjax`
will be present in all pages and articles where MathJax should be present.
The template designer can detect this and then use the `MATHJAXSCRIPT` setting
which will contain the user specified MathJax script to insert into the content.

For example, this code could be used:
```
{% if not MATH['auto_insert'] %}
    {% if page and page.mathjax or article and article.mathjax %}
        {{ MATHJAXSCRIPT }}
    {% endif %}
{% endif %}
```

### Settings
Certain MathJax rendering options can be set. These options 
are in a dictionary variable called `MATH` in the pelican
settings file.

The dictionary can be set with the following keys:

 * `auto_insert`: controls whether plugin should automatically insert
MathJax JavaScript in content that has Math. It is only recommended
to set this to False if you are a template designer and you want
extra control over where the MathJax JavaScript is renderd. **Default Value**:
True
 * `wrap_latex`: controls the tags that LaTex math is wrapped with inside the resulting
html. For example, setting `wrap_latex` to `mathjax` would wrap all LaTex math inside
`<mathjax>...</mathjax>` tags. If typogrify is set to True, then math needs
to be wrapped in tags and `wrap_latex` will therefore default to `mathjax` if not
set. `wrap_latex` cannot be set to `'math'` because this tag is reserved for 
mathml notation. **Default Value**: None unless Typogrify is enabled in which case, 
it defaults to `mathjax`
 * `align`: controls how displayed math will be aligned. Can be set to either
`left`, `right` or `center`. **Default Value**: `center`.
 * `indent`: if `align` not set to `center`, then this controls the indent
level. **Default Value**: `0em`.
 * `show_menu`: a boolean value that controls whether the mathjax contextual 
menu is shown. **Default Value**: True
 * `process_escapes`: a boolean value that controls whether mathjax processes escape 
sequences. **Default Value**: True
 * `latex_preview`: controls the preview message users are seen while mathjax is
rendering LaTex. If set to `Tex`, then the TeX code is used as the preview 
(which will be visible until it is processed by MathJax). **Default Value**: `Tex`
 * `color`: controls the color of the mathjax rendered font. **Default Value**: `black`
 * `ssl`: specifies if ssl should be used to load MathJax engine. Can be set to one
of three things
  * `auto`: **Default Value** will automatically determine what protodol to use 
based on current protocol of the site. 
  * `force`: will force ssl to be used.
  * `off`: will ensure that ssl is not used

For example, in settings.py, the following would make math render in blue and
displaymath align to the left:

    MATH = {'color':'blue','align':left}

LaTex Examples
--------------
###Inline
LaTex between `$`..`$`, for example, `$`x^2`$`, will be rendered inline
with respect to the current html block.

###Displayed Math
LaTex between `$$`..`$$`, for example, `$$`x^2`$$`, will be rendered centered in a
new paragraph.

###Equations
LaTex between `\begin` and `\end`, for example, `begin{equation}` x^2 `\end{equation}`,
will be rendered centered in a new paragraph with a right justified equation number
at the top of the paragraph. This equation number can be referenced in the document.
To do this, use a `label` inside of the equation format and then refer to that label
using `ref`. For example: `begin{equation}` `\label{eq}` X^2 `\end{equation}`. Now
refer to that equation number by `$`\ref{eq}`$`.

MathML Examples
---------------
The following will render the Quadratic formula:
```
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"> 
  <mrow>
    <mi>x</mi>
    <mo>=</mo>
    <mfrac>
      <mrow>
        <mo>&#x2212;</mo>
        <mi>b</mi>
        <mo>&#xB1;</mo>
        <msqrt>

# Summary

This plugin extracts a representative image (i.e, featured image) from the article's summary or article's content. The image can be access at `article.featured_image`. 

The plugin also remove any images from the summary after extraction to avoid duplication. 

It allows the flexibility on where and how to display the featured image of an article together with its summary in a template page. For example, the article metadata can be displayed in thumbnail format, in which there is a short summary and an image. The layout of the summary and the image can be varied for aesthetical purpose. It doesn't have to depend on article's content format.

Why do you need it?
===================

Almost all website have share widgets to let readers share posts on social
networks. Most of these widgets are used by vendors for online tracking. These
widgets are also visual which quite often become a distraction and negatively
affect readers attention.

`share_post` creates old school URLs for some popular sites which your theme
can use. These links do not have the ability to track the users. They can also
be unobtrusive depending on how Pelican theme uses them.

Requirements
============

`share_post` requires BeautifulSoup

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

How to Use
==========

`share_post` adds a dictionary attribute to `article` which can be accessed via
`article.share_post`. Keys of the dictionary are as follows,

1. `facebook`
1. `google-plus`
1. `email`
1. `twitter`

Template Example
================

```python
{% if article.share_post and article.status != 'draft' %}
<section>
    <p id="post-share-links">
        Share on:
        <a href="{{article.share_post['twitter']}}" target="_blank" title="Share on Twitter">Twitter</a>
        ‚ùÑ
        <a href="{{article.share_post['facebook']}}" target="_blank" title="Share on Facebook">Facebook</a>
        ‚ùÑ
        <a href="{{article.share_post['google-plus']}}" target="_blank" title="Share on Google Plus">Google+</a>
        ‚ùÑ
        <a href="{{article.share_post['email']}}" target="_blank" title="Share via Email">Email</a>
    </p>
</section>
{% endif %}
```


Simple Footnotes
================

A Pelican plugin to add footnotes to blog posts.

When writing a post or page, add a footnote like this:

    Here's my written text[ref]and here is a footnote[/ref].

This will appear as, roughly:

Here's my written text<sup>1</sup>

 1. and here is a footnote ‚Ü©

Inspired by Andrew Nacin's [Simple Footnotes WordPress plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-footnotes/).

Requirements
============

Needs html5lib, so you'll want to `pip install html5lib` before running.

Should work with any content format (ReST, Markdown, whatever), because
it looks for the `[ref]` and `[/ref]` once the conversion to HTML has happened.

Sitemap
-------

The sitemap plugin generates plain-text or XML sitemaps. You can use the
``SITEMAP`` variable in your settings file to configure the behavior of the
plugin.

The ``SITEMAP`` variable must be a Python dictionary and can contain three keys:

- ``format``, which sets the output format of the plugin (``xml`` or ``txt``)

- ``priorities``, which is a dictionary with three keys:

  - ``articles``, the priority for the URLs of the articles and their
    translations

  - ``pages``, the priority for the URLs of the static pages

  - ``indexes``, the priority for the URLs of the index pages, such as tags,
     author pages, categories indexes, archives, etc...

  All the values of this dictionary must be decimal numbers between ``0`` and ``1``.

- ``changefreqs``, which is a dictionary with three items:

  - ``articles``, the update frequency of the articles

  - ``pages``, the update frequency of the pages

  - ``indexes``, the update frequency of the index pages

  Valid frequency values are ``always``, ``hourly``, ``daily``, ``weekly``, ``monthly``,
  ``yearly`` and ``never``.

If a key is missing or a value is incorrect, it will be replaced with the
default value.

The sitemap is saved in ``<output_path>/sitemap.<format>``.

.. note::
   ``priorities`` and ``changefreqs`` are information for search engines.
   They are only used in the XML sitemaps.
   For more information: <http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html#xmlTagDefinitions>

**Example**

Here is an example configuration (it's also the default settings):

.. code-block:: python

    PLUGINS=['pelican.plugins.sitemap',]

    SITEMAP = {
        'format': 'xml',
        'priorities': {
            'articles': 0.5,
            'indexes': 0.5,
            'pages': 0.5
        },
        'changefreqs': {
            'articles': 'monthly',
            'indexes': 'daily',
            'pages': 'monthly'
        }
    }

Static comments
---------------

This plugin allows you to add static comments to an article. By default the
plugin looks for the comments of each article in a local file named
``comments/{slug}.md``, where ``{slug}`` is the value of the slug tag for the
article. The comments file should be formatted using markdown.

Set the ``STATIC_COMMENTS`` parameter to True to enable the plugin. Default is
False.

Set the ``STATIC_COMMENTS_DIR`` parameter to the directory where the comments
are located. Default is ``comments``.

On the template side, you just have to add a section for the comments to your
``article.html``, as in this example::

    {% if STATIC_COMMENTS %}
    <section id="comments" class="body">
    <h2>Comments!</h2>
    {{ article.metadata.static_comments }}
    </section>
    {% endif %}

Here is an example of usage:
<http://jesrui.sdf-eu.org/pelican-static-comments.html>

#Subcategory Plugin#

This plugin adds support for subcategories in addition to article categories.

Subcategories are hierarchical. Each subcategory has a parent, which is either a
regular category or another subcategory.

Feeds can be generated for each subcategory, just like categories and tags.

##Usage##

Subcategories are an extension to categories. Add subcategories to an article's
category metadata using a `/` like this:

    Category: Regular Category/Sub-Category/Sub-Sub-category

Then create a `subcategory.html` template in your theme, similar to the
`category.html` or `tag.html` templates.

In your templates, `article.category` continues to act the same way. Your
subcategories are stored in the `articles.subcategories` list. To create
breadcrumb-style navigation you might try something like this:

    <nav class="breadcrumb">
    <ol>
        <li>
            <a href="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ article.category.url }}">{{ article.category}}</a>
        </li>
    {% for subcategory in article.subcategories %}
        <li>
            <a href="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ subcategory.url }}">{{ subcategory.shortname }}</a>
        </li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ol>
    </nav>

##Subcategory Names##

Each subcategory's full name is a `/`-separated list of it parents and itself.
This is necessary to keep each subcategory unique. It means you can have
`Category 1/Foo` and `Category 2/Foo` and they won't interfere with each other.
Each subcategory has an attribute `shortname` which is just the name without
its parents associated. For example if you had‚Ä¶

    Category/Sub Category1/Sub Category2

‚Ä¶ the full name for Sub Category2 would be `Category/Sub Category1/Sub Category2` and
the "short name" would be `Sub Category2`.

If you need to use the slug, it is generated from the short name ‚Äî not the full
name.

##Settings##

Consistent with the default settings for Tags and Categories, the default
settings for subcategories are:

    'SUBCATEGORY_SAVE_AS' = os.path.join('subcategory', '{savepath}.html')
    'SUBCATEGORY_URL' = 'subcategory/(fullurl).html'

`savepath` and `fullurl` are generated recursively, using slugs. So the full
URL would be:

    category-slug/sub-category-slug/sub-sub-category-slug

‚Ä¶ with `savepath` being similar but joined using `os.path.join`.

Similarly, you can save subcategory feeds by adding one of the following
to your Pelican configuration file:

    SUBCATEGORY_FEED_ATOM = 'feeds/%s.atom.xml'
    SUBCATEGORY_FEED_RSS = 'feeds/%s.rss.xml'

‚Ä¶ and this will create a feed with `fullurl` of the subcategory. For example:

    feeds/category/subcategory.atom.xml

Summary
-------

This plugin allows easy, variable length summaries directly embedded into the 
body of your articles. It introduces two new settings: ``SUMMARY_BEGIN_MARKER``
and ``SUMMARY_END_MARKER``: strings which can be placed directly into an article
to mark the beginning and end of a summary. When found, the standard 
``SUMMARY_MAX_LENGTH`` setting will be ignored. The markers themselves will also
be removed from your articles before they are published. The default values
are ``<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->`` and ``<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->``.
For example::

    Title: My super title
    Date: 2010-12-03 10:20
    Tags: thats, awesome
    Category: yeah
    Slug: my-super-post
    Author: Alexis Metaireau
    
    This is the content of my super blog post.
    <!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->
    and this content occurs after the summary.

Here, the summary is taken to be the first line of the post. Because no
beginning marker was found, it starts at the top of the body. It is possible
to leave out the end marker instead, in which case the summary will start at the
beginning marker and continue to the end of the body.

Title: A markdown powered article

Test Data
---------

Place tests for your plugin here. ``test_data`` folder contains following
common data for your tests, if you need them. 

===============   ===========================
File/Folder       Description
===============   ===========================
content           A sample content folder
themes            Default themes from Pelican
pelican.conf.py   A sample settings file
===============   ===========================

Thumbnail Creation of images
============================

This plugin creates thumbnails for all of the images found under a specific directory, in various thumbnail sizes
It requires PIL to function properly since PIL is used to resize the images, and will only rebuild a thumbnail if it
doesn't already exists (to save processing time)

Installation
-------------

Setup up like a normal plugin by setting PLUGIN_PATH, and adding "thumbnailer" to the PLUGINS list

Configuration
-------------

* IMAGE_PATH is the path to the image directory.  It should reside under content, and defaults to "pictures"
* THUMBNAIL_DIR is the path to the output sub directory where the thumbnails are generated
* THUMBNAIL_SIZES is a dictionary mapping name of size to size specifications.
  The generated filename will be originalname_thumbnailname.ext unless THUMBNAIL_KEEP_NAME is set.
* THUMBNAIL_KEEP_NAME is a boolean which if set puts the file with the original name in a thumbnailname folder.

Sizes can be specified using any of the following formats:

* wxh will resize to exactly wxh cropping as necessary to get that size
* wx? will resize so that the width is the specified size, and the height will scale to retain aspect ratio
* ?xh same as wx? but will height being a set size
* s is a shorthand for wxh where w=h
Tipue Search
============

A Pelican plugin to serialize generated HTML to JSON that can be used by jQuery plugin - Tipue Search.

Why do you need it?
===================

Static sites do not offer search feature out of the box. [Tipue Search](http://www.tipue.com/search/)
is a jQuery plugin that search the static site without using any third party service, like DuckDuckGo or Google.

Tipue Search offers 4 search modes. Its [JSON search mode](http://www.tipue.com/search/docs/json/) is the best search mode
especially for large sites.

Tipue's JSON search mode requires the textual content of site in JSON format.

Requirements
============

Tipue Search requires BeautifulSoup.

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

How Tipue Search works
=========================

Tipue Search serializes the generated HTML into JSON. Format of JSON is as follows

```python
{
    "pages": [
        { 
            "text": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer nec odio. Praesent libero. Sed cursus ante dapibus diam. Sed nisi. Nulla quis sem at nibh elementum imperdiet. Duis sagittis ipsum. Praesent mauris. Fusce nec tellus sed augue semper porta. Mauris massa. Vestibulum lacinia arcu eget nulla. Class aptent taciti sociosqu ad litora torquent per conubia nostra, per inceptos himenaeos. Curabitur sodales ligula in libero.",
            "tags": "Example Category",
            "loc" : "http://oncrashreboot.com/plugin-example.html",
            "title": "Everything you want to know about Lorem Ipsum"
        },
        { 
            "text": "Sed dignissim lacinia nunc. Curabitur tortor. Pellentesque nibh. Aenean quam. In scelerisque sem at dolor. Maecenas mattis. Sed convallis tristique sem. Proin ut ligula vel nunc egestas porttitor. Morbi lectus risus, iaculis vel, suscipit quis, luctus non, massa. Fusce ac turpis quis ligula lacinia aliquet. Mauris ipsum. Nulla metus metus, ullamcorper vel, tincidunt sed, euismod in, nibh.",
            "tags": "Example Category",
            "loc" : "http://oncrashreboot.com/plugin-example-2.html",
            "title": "Review of the book Lorem Ipsum"
        }
    ]
}
```

JSON is written to file `tipuesearch_content.json` which is created in the root of `output` directory.

How to use
==========

To utilize JSON Search mode, your theme needs to have Tipue Search properly configured in it. [Official documentation](http://www.tipue.com/search/docs/json/) has the required details.

Pelican [Elegant Theme](https://github.com/talha131/pelican-elegant) has Tipue Search configured. You can view its code to understand the configuration. 

Twitter Bootstrap Directive for restructured text
-------------------------------------------------

This plugin defines some rst directive that enable a clean usage of the twitter bootstrap CSS and Javascript components.

Directives
----------

Implemented directives:

    label,
    alert,
    panel,
    media

Implemented roles:

    glyph,
    code,
    kbd

Usage
-----

For more informations about the usage of each directive, read the corresponding class description.
Or checkout this demo page.

Dependencies
------------

In order to use this plugin, you need to use a template that supports bootstrap 3.1.1 with the glyph font setup
correctly. Usually you should have this structure::

    static
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  css
    |     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ  bootstrap.min.css
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  font
    |     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ  glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ  js
          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ     

Warning
-------

In order to support some unique features and avoid conflicts with bootstrap, this plugin will use a custom html writer which
is modifying the traditional docutils output.
# w3c_validate plugin

This is a plugin for Pelican that submits generated HTML content to the
[W3C Markup Validation Service](http://validator.w3.org/).

After all content is generated, the output folder is traversed for HTML files,
and the content is submitted to the W3C validator, after which the results
are displayed. For example:

    -> writing /tmp/_output/sitemap.xml
    -> Validating: /tmp/_output/archives.html
    ERROR: line: 2; col: 52; message: Bad value http://www.w3.org/1999/html for the attribute xmlns (only http://www.w3.
    -> Validating: /tmp/_output/categories.html
    ERROR: line: 2; col: 52; message: Bad value http://www.w3.org/1999/html for the attribute xmlns (only http://www.w3.

**Note**: The above output assumes you have called Pelican with the ``--debug``
flag. Otherwise, you will see errors (if any) but not the file currently being
validated.

## Dependencies

* [py_w3c](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py_w3c/0.1.0), which can be installed with pip:

    $ pip install py_w3c
