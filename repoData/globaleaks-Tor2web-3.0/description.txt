# Tor2web

## Introduction

Tor2web is a web proxy software that let you access Tor Hidden Services from
the Internet under the domain *.tor2web.org (or other you make configure)
rather than by using .onion, reachable only from within Tor Darknet.
Take a look [www.tor2web.org](http://www.tor2web.org/) or [wiki.tor2web.org](http://wiki.tor2web.org/)
for more general information, here follow the technical documentation.

Tor2web is part of a larger project ([GlobaLeaks](https://github.com/globaleaks/GlobaLeaks/wiki/)),
and is a crucial point in an architectural design aimed to make
Tor Hidden Services (HS) easily reachable for all internet users,
even if they have not installed Tor.
