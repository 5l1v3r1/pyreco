Gedit Source Code Browser
=========================

A source code class and function browser plugin for Gedit 3. 

* Author: Micah Carrick

This plugin will add a new tab to the side pane in the Gedit text editor which
shows symbols (functions, classes, variables, etc.) for the active document. 
Clicking a symbol in the list wil jump to the line on which that symbol is 
defined.

See the [ctags supported languages](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/languages.html)
for a list of the 41 programming languages supported by this plugin.


Requirements
------------

This plugins is for Gedit 3 and is **not compatible with Gedit 2.x**. 

The Gedit Source Code Browser plugin uses 
[Exuberant Ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) to parse symbols
out of source code. Exuberant Ctags is avaialable in the software repository for
many distributions. To make sure you have ctags correctly installed, issue
the following command:

    ctags --version
    
Make sure that you see *Exuberant* Ctags in the version output.

1. Download this repository by clicking the Downloads button at the top of the 
   github page or issue the following command in a terminal:

    git clone git://github.com/Quixotix/gedit-source-code-browser.git

2. Copy the file `sourcecodebrowser.plugin` and the folder `sourcecodebrowser` to
   `~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/`.

   the 'Plugins' tab, and checking the box next to 'Soucre Code Browser'.

    cp org.gnome.gedit.plugins.sourcecodebrowser.gschema.xml /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/

Known Issues
------------

* CSS is not supported. This issue is about ctags and not this plugin. You can
  [extend ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/EXTENDING.html) to add support for 
  any language you like. Many people have provided their fixes to on internet 
  such as this [patch for CSS support](http://scie.nti.st/2006/12/22/how-to-add-css-support-to-ctags).
  
* PHP is supported, however, PHP5 classes are not well supported. This is again
  an issue with ctags. There are numerous fixes to be found onn the internet
  such as these 
  [patches for better PHP5 support](http://www.jejik.com/articles/2008/11/patching_exuberant-ctags_for_better_php5_support_in_vim/).
