
KeySync - One key for all of your chat apps
===========================================

There are many chat apps that support OTR encryption for verifying messages.
Many of us use multiple chat apps, including one for desktop and another for
mobile, or one for Mac OS X and another for GNU/Linux or Windows.  The trust
relationships are only stored locally in the app in a format that is specific
to that app.  Switching between all of them means that you have to manage your
trust relationships for each app that you use.

KeySync addresses this problem by allowing you to sync your OTR identity and
trust relationships between multiple apps, which eliminates the need to
re-establish those relationships on each new client/device. It currently works
with ChatSecure on Android, and Pidgin, Adium, and Jitsi on desktop.

Please note: KeySync does not make it easier to have simultaneous encrypted
chats with the same account logged into multiple clients or devices.  There
are limitations in the OTR protocol that make this impossible.


How to sync
-----------

To sync between ChatSecure and your desktop apps, plug in your phone or device
via USB and run the sync.  Or you can manually copy the `otr_keystore.ofcaes`
file over to your device's SD Card, where ChatSecure looks for it.  Using
ChatSecure, you will need to scan the QRCode that KeySync shows you in order
to complete the sync.  The `otr_keystore.ofcaes` file is encrypted to prevent
your private information from leaking out.  That QRCode is the password to
your keystore, so do not share it with anyone.

If you have multiple chat apps that you use, or you are switching from one to
another, you can use KeySync to sync up the trust relationships between
multiple desktop apps.  Here's how:

1. quit all of the chat apps that you want to
2. select whichever apps you want to sync
3. then run the sync

Now, open your chat apps and you should have synced trust!  In case of
problems, it saved your original OTR files in place.  They are named using a
long string of numbers that represent the time when they were backed up.

This is beta software, do not rely on it for strong identity verification.  It
is unlikely to mess up so bad as to produce compromised private keys, but
anything is possible.  Also, keep in mind that program is handling your
private OTR keys, so make sure that you don't copy, send or email the
`otr_keystore.ofcaes` file somewhere unsafe.  All that said, testing
and feedback is greatly appreciated, so we can get it to the point where we
can trust it.


Adding apps to KeySync
----------------------

This project has libraries for converting the various OTR file formats between
each other.  We have focused on the two major versions: libotr format and otr4j,
and then a few variants of those major formats.  All OTR implementations can
be supported as long as they can be read and parsed by Python.

KeySync has preliminary support for Gajim and IRSSI, and it has a modular
architecture to allow for expansion.  If you want to add an app that is not
already included, you just need to make a single python file that converts
between that app's OTR data format and the KeySync internal format (documented
below).

Debian/Ubuntu/Mint/etc
----------------------

We're working to get all packages into official Debian/Ubuntu/etc. releases,
in the meantime you can install KeySync by adding our PPA (fingerprint
F50EADDD2234F563):

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:guardianproject/ppa
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install keysync

PPA URL: https://launchpad.net/~guardianproject/+archive/ppa

If you want to install the dependencies because you're going to develop
KeySync, then install them manually with:

    sudo apt-get install python-pyparsing python-pyasn1 python-potr python-pymtp \
      python-pyjavaproperties python-beautifulsoup python-qrcode libmtp-dev \
      python-pgpdump python-crypto python-psutil python-tk python-imaging-tk

For Debian, you can try using the Ubuntu PPA, with something like oneiric for
wheezy, and natty for squeeze:

  deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/guardianproject/ppa/ubuntu oneiric main


Mac OS X
--------

For Mac OS X, you can download the binary app from our website:
https://guardianproject.info

You use Brew, Fink, or MacPorts to install pip and virtualenv, then
use those tools to install KeySync (see the *pip+virtualenv install*
section):

    fink install pip-systempython26 virtualenv-systempython26
    sudo port install py27-pip py27-virtualenv

For homebrew, see: https://gist.github.com/pithyless/1208841

Once you have pip and virtualenv, then you can start to build the
whole thing.  First follow the pip+virtualenv instructions below.
Then come back here and do the following in your virtualenv:

    rm -rf build dist
    pip install py2app
    python setup.py py2app
    ls dist/

If you are using py2app older than 0.7.4 on Mac OS X 10.6, then you
need to patch py2app to make it work with python2.6:

    pip install --upgrade py2app
    patch env/lib/python2.6/site-packages/py2app/build_app.py py2app-python2.6.patch


Windows
-------

For Windows, you can download the binary app from our website:
https://guardianproject.info

Build instructions for Windows are in win32/README.md in the source folder.

Fedora/Redhat/RPMs
------------------

Install these build dependencies locally, then follow the instructions for
pip+virtualenv below:

    sudo yum install gmp-devel tk tkinter python-pillow python-pillow-tk


pip+virtualenv install
------------------

Activate your virtual python environment then run pip to install the dependencies:

    virtualenv ./env
    . env/bin/activate
    pip install -e .
    ./keysync

For a nice step-by-step HOWTO, see:
http://exyr.org/2011/virtualenv-HOWTO/slides.html

*Note*: Doesn't work on Windows! See win32/README.md


=====
USAGE
=====

Currently, the code allows for reading multiple file formats into a python
dictionary form.  The only export method currently activated is for ChatSecure
format in a file called otr_keystore.ofcaes.  To use, point the `keysync`
script the app that you want to read OTR info from, and it will generate
`otr_keystore` to send to ChatSecure on your Android device (run
`keysync --help` to see all currently available options).

  keysync --input pidgin


=======
FORMATS
=======

libotr
------

Adium:
  ~/Library/Application Support/Adium 2.0/Users/Default/otr.private_key
  ~/Library/Application Support/Adium 2.0/Users/Default/otr.fingerprints
  ~/Library/Application Support/Adium 2.0/Users/Default/Accounts.plist

  Uses the standard libotr files and overall file format for
  otr.private_key and otr.fingerprints.  Account ID is stored as an
  integer which must be referenced from the Accounts.plist to get the
  actuall XMPP account name (e.g. me@jabber.org). Uses full word
  descriptive tags for the various protocols, e.g. libpurple-oscar-AIM,
  libpurple-Jabber, etc.

Pidgin
 GNU/Linux
  ~/.purple/otr.private_key
  ~/.purple/otr.fingerprints
 Windows
  %APPDATA%\.purple\otr.private_key
  %APPDATA%\.purple\otr.fingerprints

  Uses the standard libotr files and overall file format for
  otr.private_key and otr.fingerprints. Account IDs are used directly
  in the libotr files. XMPP/Jabber Account IDs include the "Resource"
  e.g. me@jabber.org/Resource or me@jabber.org/Pidgin.

irssi
  ~/.irssi/otr/otr.key
  ~/.irssi/otr/otr.fp

  Uses the standard libotr file format and files, but names the files
  differently, basically abbreviated versions of the libotr names.
  Account IDs are used directly in the libotr files.

xchat
  ~/.xchat2/otr/otr.key
  ~/.xchat2/otr/otr.fp

  Same as irssi

otr4j
-----

ChatSecure:
  /data/data/info.guardianproject.otr.app.im/files/otr_keystore

  All OTR information is stored in a single Java .properties
  file. Private keys, public key fingerprints, and verification status
  are each individual properties.  This format also includes the
  storage of the remote public keys, unlike libotr.  otr4j
  implementations load the remote public key from the store rather
  than always getting it from the OTR session.

Jitsi:
 GNU/Linux
  ~/.jitsi/sip-communicator.properties
  ~/.jitsi/contactlist.xml
 Mac OS X
  ~/Library/Application Support/Jitsi/sip-communicator.properties
  ~/Library/Application Support/Jitsi/contactlist.xml
 Windows
  ~/Application Data/Jitsi/sip-communicator.properties
  ~/Application Data/Jitsi/contactlist.xml

  All app settings are stored in a single Java .properties file,
  including OTR information. Private keys, public key fingerprints,
  and verification status are each individual properties.


pure-python-otr
---------------

pure-python-otr is pure python implementation of the OTR spec.  It
includes newer features like Socialist Millionaire's Protocol.  The
private key is stored in a separate file per-account.  The
fingerprints are stored in the same tab-separated-value format as
libotr but with a fingerprint file per-account.

Gajim:
  GNU/Linux:
    ~/.local/share/gajim/_SERVERNAME_.key3
    ~/.local/share/gajim/_SERVERNAME_.fpr
    ~/.config/gajim/config
  Windows:
    ~/Application Data/Gajim/

The private key is serialized in a custom format: p, q, g, y, x, written
consecutively to a file as MPIs. See
[potr/compatcrypto/pycrypto.py](https://github.com/afflux/pure-python-otr/blob/master/src/potr/compatcrypto/pycrypto.py).


keyczar
-------

KeyCzar stores keys in JSON files with two different formats: 0.5b and
0.6b.  It uses a special base64 encoding with a URL-safe alphabet:
  - replaces +
  _ replaces /

http://code.google.com/p/keyczar/wiki/DsaPrivateKey
http://code.google.com/p/keyczar/wiki/DsaPublicKey

 0.6b
  public:
    "q": The DSA subprime
    "p": The DSA prime
    "g": The DSA base
    "y": The DSA public key exponent
    "size" : The size of the modulus in bits
  private:
    "publicKey": The JSON representation of the corresponding DsaPublicKey
    "x": The secret exponent of this private key
    "size" : The size of the modulus in bits

 0.5b
  public:
     "x509": A WebSafeBase64 encoded X509 representation
  private:
     "pkcs8": A WebSafeBase64 encoded PKCS#8 representation of the private key
     "publicKey": A WebSafeBase64 encoding of the key's corresponding DsaPublicKey


ZRTP
----

A ZID record stores (caches) ZID (ZRTP ID) specific data that helps
ZRTP to achives its key continuity feature. Please refer to the ZRTP
specification to get detailed information about the ZID.

 ZRTP key types:
  2048 bit Diffie-Helman values
  3072 bit Diffie-Helman values
  256 bit Diffie-Helman elliptic curve
  384 bit Diffie-Helman elliptic curve



IMPLEMENTATION
==============

Here are some notes on how things are implemented in KeySync.

Internal key storage
--------------------

The key idea in the implementation is to get everything into a common format
internally.  That common format can then be handed to any class for a given
program, which knows how to output it to the correct file format.  The current
internal data format is a dict of dicts representing a key, called 'keydict'.
So first, you have a dict representing a given account with a given key
associated with it.  This account name is used as the unique ID.  Then the
whole collection of keys, both local private keys and remote public keys, are
collected in meta dict with the account name as the key and the whole dict as
the value. This format allows for easy merging, which enables syncing between
files.

Sample structure in python dict notation:

    keydict = {
        'userid': {
                    'fingerprint': 'ff66e8c909c4deb51cbd4a02b9e6af4d6af215f8',
                    'name': 'userid',
                    'protocol': 'IRC',
                    'resource': 'laptop', # the XMPP "resource"
                    'verification': 'verified', # or 'smp' for Socialist Millionares
                    'p': '<p value>', # public part of the DSA key
                    'q': '<q value>', # public part of the DSA key
                    'g': '<g value>', # public part of the DSA key
                    'x': '<x value>', # core of private DSA key
                    'y': '<y value>', # core of public DSA key
                },
        'userid2' : { ... },
        ...
        'useridn' : { ... }
    }


Protocol IDs
------------

Unfortunately each app has its own string IDs to represent the different IM
protocols.  KeySync uses the Pidgin IDs internally.  KeySync is currently
focused on the widely deployed common standards of XMPP and IRC. We welcome
contributions for working with the other protocols. These are the IDs that are
currently working throughout:

prpl-bonjour  XMPP Bonjour (serverless XMPP with mDNS discovery)
prpl-irc      IRC (Internet Relay Chat)
prpl-jabber   XMPP (Jabber)

Here is the full list of IDs from Pidgin:

## Install Prerequisites

### MingW

1. Execute the installer
2. Follow the wizard
3. When prompted in the installer choose this options:

```
    C compiler
    C++ compiler

1. Execute the vcredist_x86.exe package
2. Install it completely
3. Execute the OpenSSL installer
4. When prompted choose "Copy OpenSSL DLLs to:  The OpenSSL binaries (/bin) directory"

### Python

1. Execute the Python installer, use default options
    * Linux+Wine: you must use `msiexec /i python-2.7.5.msi`

## Post Python Install Configuration

**Configure the PATH environment variable**

Windows:

1. Right-click on My Computer and select properties
2. Go to the 'Advanced' section and select 'Environment variables'
3. Select 'Path' from the 'System Variables' and click the 'Edit button'
4. Append the following to your PATH variable:

    ```
    C:\MinGW\bin;C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts;C:\OpenSSL-Win32\bin;
    ```

Linux+Wine:

1. Open regedit using the `regedit` command
2. Edit `HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Environment`
3. Add a new String value called `PATH` using the value above

**Set Python to use MinGW**

1. Create the following file: C:\Python27\Lib\distutils\distutils.cfg
2. Append:

```
    [build]
    compiler=mingw32
```
3. Save and close

**Fix -mno-cygwin error**

To prevent the following error when building Python modules, we must edit a distutils file.

    gcc: error: unrecognized command line option '-mno-cygwin'

1. Edit the file `C:\Python27\Lib\distutils\cygwinccompiler.py`
2. Look for the class: `Mingw32CCompiler` around line 297
3. Find the block that beings with 'self.set_executables('
4. Delete all the '-mno-cygwin' flags
5. Save and close


## Install Python Dependencies

Note: your $HOME when using MinGW shell is in C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\home\USERNAME

### setuptools

1. Open your MinGW Shell
    * Windows: Start -> MinGW -> MinGW Shell
    * Linux+Wine: `wine cmd.exe /C C:\MinGW/msys/1.0/msys.bat`
2. cd to where you downloaded [ez_setup.py][setuptools]
    * Windows: Access the normal windows FS using the /c/ path (i.e., /c/ corresponds to C:\)
    * Linux+Wine: Access your native root fs with /z/
3. Execute:

```bash
    python ez_setup.py
```

### Python W32 Bindings

1. Execute the Python installer, use default options

*Note*: If using a virtual environment (virtualenv), then you must open a
command shell that has your virtualenv activated and execute:

    easy_install /c/path/to/pywin32-218.win32-py2.7.exe

Otherwise pywin32 will be installed into the system site-packages dir, and not
be available to your virtualenv.


### PyCrypto

For some reason we must install PyCrypto this way, instead of relying on it to
be installed via setup.py along with the rest of the dependencies.

1. cd to your extracted pycrypto dir: `cd pycrypto-2.6`
2. `python seutp.py install`


### KeySync

1. `cd keysync`
2. `python setup.py install`

This will download, compile, and install all the remaining python modules.

## Verify Everything Works

At this point, all the dependencies for keysync should be installed
and functioning, so keysync should work. You can test it by running keysync-gui:

You'll probably want to install Pidgin, pidgin-otr, and configure an account
before running keysync.

```bash
cd keysync
python keysync-gui
```
Do not proceed unless the GUI pops up and the app functions as expected.

## Create Windows Executable with PyInstaller

Note: Due to [bug 651](http://www.pyinstaller.org/ticket/651) the development
version of PyInstaller must be used.

KeySync's setup.py script automatically installs pyinstaller, so all you need
to do is execute pyinstaller and point it at the script you want to turn into
an EXE.  Build the package:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile keysync-gui.spec
```

You can omit the `--onefile` parameter, see the [PyInstaller
Manual](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/blob/develop/doc/Manual.html)
for what exactly the consequences of both modes are.

If the process succeeds, then check the `dist/` directory
inside the pyinstaller directory.

# Security Considerations

Unfortunately most of the dependencies and toolchain used above are not
available to download over HTTPS nor do they have signatures to verify. Even
MinGW lacks any sort of secure download, so securely building the dependencies from
source may not be possible.

Also, according to [this ticket](http://sourceforge.net/p/pywin32/bugs/519/)
the Python Win32 bindings are not easily buildable with MinGW.
