=============================

#### About the show ####
Spear headed by leading Arab presenter Amr Adeeb, Al Qahera Al Youm (Arabic: القاهرة اليوم‎, English: Cairo Today) is a live television talk show that broadcasts nearly everyday throughout the year from Cairo. The program efficiently covers all aspects of life in Egypt from politics, to arts, sports, cultural and economic issues, and even international affairs. It airs on Al Yawm channel which is part of Orbit Communications Company now known as the OSN.

#### Online presence ####
Clips of the program used to be uploaded daily on to the show's official YouTube channel until recently; the official YouTube channel has been shutdown. The program clips are now instead being directly uploaded to the official program website (http://www.alqaheraalyoum.net).

#### A XBMC video plugin ####
The Al Qahera Al Youm XBMC plugin scrapes the show's online website and delivers their video clip content through XBMC for convenient consumption.

---------------------
### Installation
Install the **[Arabic XBMC addons repository](https://github.com/hadynz/repository.arabic.xbmc-addons#arabic-xbmc-repository)** and select to install this plugin from it.

F.A.Q.
------
### Why are none of the channels working?
The GLArab plugin requires that you install the GLArab proxy software on your local machine to be able to
view their streams. The proxy software is available for both Windows and Mac from the main
http://www.glarab.com website.

### Can I use this plugin with XBMC on the Apple TV?
Yes and No.

As mentioned in the previous FAQ, GLArab requires a proxy to be downloaded and installed on a machine that 
would like to stream GLArab channels. A proxy cannot be installed on Apple TV.

To get around this problem, simply do the following:
 1. Install the GLAraby proxy software from the main website on a Windows/Mac machine
 2. Configure the GLArab plugin in your Apple TV use a proxy. In the configuration of the plugin, set the proxy field to the IP address of the computer in your network that has the proxy installed.

The above solution will require that your machine with the GLArab proxy software installed to always be on.
Nothing of note yet ;)

## F.A.Q.
### When I install the repository from ZIP file, XBMC complains that it "does not have the correct structure".
This has typically meant that you have downloaded this github repository as a ZIP file (by clicking on the
'Download as zip' button) in the downloads page. Instead, you need to download the repository from the link
in the 'Download Packages' section of the downloads page.
