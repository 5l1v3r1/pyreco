# UNPACKERS SPECIFICATIONS

Nothing very difficult: an unpacker is a submodule placed in the directory
where this file was found. Each unpacker must define three symbols:

 * `PRIORITY`       : integer number expressing the priority in applying this
                      unpacker. Lower number means higher priority.
                      Makes sense only if a source file has been packed with
                      more than one packer.
 * `detect(source)` : returns `True` if source is packed, otherwise, `False`.
 * `unpack(source)` : takes a `source` string and unpacks it. Must always return
                      valid JavaScript. That is to say, your code should look
                      like:

```
if detect(source):
    return do_your_fancy_things_with(source)
else:
    return source
```

*You can safely define any other symbol in your module, as it will be ignored.*

`__init__` code will automatically load new unpackers, without any further step
to be accomplished. Simply drop it in this directory.
