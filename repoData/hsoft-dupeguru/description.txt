This module is common code used in all Hardcoded Software applications. It has no stable API so
it is not recommended to actually depend on it. But if you want to copy bits and pieces for your own
apps, be my guest.

# dupeGuru

[dupeGuru][dupeguru] is a cross-platform (Linux, OS X, Windows) GUI tool to find duplicate files in
a system. It's written mostly in Python 3 and has the peculiarity of using
[multiple GUI toolkits][cross-toolkit], all using the same core Python code. On OS X, the UI layer
is written in Objective-C and uses Cocoa. On Linux and Windows, it's written in Python and uses Qt5.

dupeGuru comes in 3 editions (standard, music and picture) which are all buildable from this same
source tree. You choose the edition you want to build in a ``configure.py`` flag.

# Contents of this folder

This folder contains the source for dupeGuru. Its documentation is in ``help``, but is also
[available online][documentation] in its built form. Here's how this source tree is organised:

* core: Contains the core logic code for dupeGuru. It's Python code.
* core_*: Edition-specific-cross-toolkit code written in Python.
* cocoa: UI code for the Cocoa toolkit. It's Objective-C code.
* qt: UI code for the Qt toolkit. It's written in Python and uses PyQt.
* images: Images used by the different UI codebases.
* pkg: Skeleton files required to create different packages
* help: Help document, written for Sphinx.
* locale: .po files for localisation.

There are also other sub-folder that comes from external repositories and are part of this repo as
git subtrees:

* hscommon: A collection of helpers used across HS applications.
* cocoalib: A collection of helpers used across Cocoa UI codebases of HS applications.
* qtlib: A collection of helpers used across Qt UI codebases of HS applications.

# How to build dupeGuru from source

## The very, very, very easy way

If you're on Linux or Mac, there's a bootstrap script that will make building very, very easy. There
might be some things that you need to install manually on your system, but the bootstrap script will
tell you when what you need to install. You can run the bootstrap with:

    ./bootstrap.sh

and follow instructions from the script. You can then ignore the rest of the build documentation.

## Prerequisites installation

Prerequisites are installed through `pip`. However, some of them are not "pip installable" and have
to be installed manually.

* All systems: [Python 3.3+][python] and [setuptools][setuptools]
* Mac OS X: The last XCode to have the 10.7 SDK included. Python 3.4+.
* Windows: Visual Studio 2010, [PyQt 5.0+][pyqt], [cx_Freeze][cxfreeze] and
  [Advanced Installer][advinst] (you only need the last two if you want to create an installer)

On Ubuntu (14.04+), the apt-get command to install all pre-requisites is:

    $ apt-get install python3-dev python3-pyqt5 pyqt5-dev-tools

On Arch, it's:

    $ pacman -S python-pyqt5

## Setting up the virtual environment

Use Python's built-in `pyvenv` to create a virtual environment in which we're going to install our.
Python-related dependencies. `pyvenv` is built-in Python but, unlike its `virtualenv` predecessor,
it doesn't install setuptools and pip, so it has to be installed manually:

    $ pyvenv --system-site-packages env
    $ source env/bin/activate
    $ wget https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py -O - | python
    $ easy_install pip

Then, you can install pip requirements in your virtualenv:

    $ pip install -r requirements-[osx|win].txt
    
([osx|win] depends, of course, on your platform. On other platforms, just use requirements.txt).

## Actual building and running

With your virtualenv activated, you can build and run dupeGuru with these commands:

    $ python configure.py
    $ python build.py
    $ python run.py

You can also package dupeGuru into an installable package with:
    
    $ python package.py
