# PlexConnect
or: "Plex @ aTV - think different..."

We all want the pleasure of Plex on the big screen - in this case driven by an AppleTV.
Unfortunately there are officially no Apps allowed on AppleTV, most of the time a jailbreak is late (iOS 5.2?) or not available at all (aTV3).

This is a collection of files developed for the little project described in this [Plex Forum thread][].
See also the discontinued [ATVBrowser][] for a project with similar purpose, all javascript.

For more information, like detailed Installation Guides, FAQs and similar, visit the [Wiki][].


## How does it work?
The basic idea is, to...
- re-use an already available app (like YouTube, Vimeo, ... in this case: Apple Trailers)
- re-route the request to your local Plex Media Server
- re-work the reply to fit into AppleTV's XML communication scheme
- let iOS do the rest


## Requirements
- Python 2.6.x with minor issues: ElementTree doesn't support tag indices.
- Python 2.7.x recommended.


## Installation
```sh
# Installation
git clone https://github.com/iBaa/PlexConnect.git
# Updating
cd PlexConnect
git pull
```
> If you don't have Git, you can download [ZIP][] file and extract files to a local directory.

- create HTTPS/SSL certificate
- install certificate to ```assets/certificate/```
- install certificate on aTV

See the [Wiki - Install Guide][] for additional documentation.


## Usage
```sh
# Run with root privileges
sudo ./PlexConnect.py
```
> Depending on your OS, you might only need ```PlexConnect.py```. Or ```python PlexConnect.py``` or ...

- set your AppleTV's DNS address to the computer running PlexConnect
- run the Trailer App

See the [Wiki - Advanced Settings][] for more details on configuration and advanced settings.


## More detailed Information about the files
* __PlexConnect.py__ - 
Main script file, invoking the DNSServer and WebServer into seperate processes.
* __PlexAPI.py__ - 
Collection of Plex Media Server/MyPlex "connector functions": Auto discovery of running PMSs: Good Day Mate! // XML interface to local PMSs // MyPlex integration
* __DNSServer.py__ - 
This is a small DNS server (hence the name) that is now called whenever aTV needs to resolve an internet address. To hijack the trailer App, we will intercept and re-route all queries to trailers.apple.com. Every other query will be forwarded to the next, your original DNS.
* __WebServer.py__ - 
This script provides the directory content of "assets" to aTV. Additionally it will forward aTV's directory requests to PMS and provide a aTV compatible XML back.
Every media (video, thumbnails...) is URL-wise connected to PMS, so aTV directly accesses the Plex database.
* __XMLConverter.py__ - 
This script contains the XML adaption from Plex Media Server's response to valid aTV XML files.
* __Settings.py__ - 
Basic settings collection. Creates ```Settings.cfg``` at first run - which may be modified externally.
* __ATVSettings.py__ - 
Handles the aTV settings like ViewModes or Transcoder options. Stores aTV settings in ```ATVSettings.cfg```.
* __Localize.py__ -
Holds a couple of utility functions for text translation purposes. Uses dictionaries from ```assets/locales/```.
* __Subtitle.py__ -
Subtitle parser functions for PlexConnect's own renderer, converts subs to JSON for easy transfer to aTV.

PlexConnect on aTV (jailbroken)



Install Python on aTV
(current version: python_2.7.3-3_iphoneos-arm.deb)
- download "https://yangapp.googlecode.com/files/python_2.7.3-3_iphoneos-arm.deb"
- SFTP "python_2.7.3-3_iphoneos-arm.deb" to your aTV
- SSH into aTV and execute...
  "apt-get update"
  "apt-get upgrade"
  just to make sure you have the latest packages
  "apt-get install cydia"
  "apt-get install python"
  this will pull and install python 2.5.1 with all dependencies
  "dpkg -i python_2.7.3-3_iphoneos-arm.deb"
  this will update python to 2.7.3

Push PlexConnect to aTV
- SFTP into aTV and copy the complete PlexConnect directory. Eg. to /Application/PlexConnect.
- SFTP PlexConnect/support/aTV_jailbreak/Settings.cfg to PlexConnect/Settings.cfg
  overwrite the later if already there
  this bring new defaults for PlexConnect@aTV, like disabling DNSServer

Install PlexConnect as daemon
- SSH into aTV
- CD into the PlexConnect directory. Eg. "cd /Application/PlexConnect"
- run "./support/aTV_jailbreak/install.bash"

/etc/hosts
- optional: add PlexConnect/support/aTV_jailbreak/hosts_addon_preventATVUpdate
  this prevents aTV update


OPTION A - run PlexConnect as always, re-using trailers.apple.com

/etc/hosts
- add content of PlexConnect/support/aTV_jailbreak/hosts_addon_PlexConnect to /etc/hosts
  this redirects the trailer app back to aTV itself, replacing the DNSServer


OPTION B - create own PlexConnect button

Install PlexConnect button to aTV home screen
- SSH into aTV
- CD into the PlexConnect directory. Eg. "cd /Application/PlexConnect"
- run "./support/aTV_jailbreak/install_button.bash"
  this will set up 
     /Library/Managed Preferences/mobile/com.apple.frontrow.plist
     /User/Library/Application Support/Front Row/ExtraInternetCategories.plist
     ./support/aTV_jailbreak/bag.plist
  and thereby enabling the AddSite hack tailored to PlexConnect.

Thanks to D. Schuetz! (https://intrepidusgroup.com/insight/2013/09/rpi-atv/)


Reboot

Done!



Debug PlexConnect

check processes
- "ps -ef" should find 3 Python/PlexConnect related processes

check launchctl
- "launchctl list | grep .plexconnect." should give "<PID>  -  com.plex.plexconnect.bash.plist"

check StdOut, StdErr
- in com.plex.plexconnect.bash.plist swap comments for StandardOutPath, StandardErrorPath payload
  dump data to real file: ./PlexConnect_stdout.log, ./PlexConnect_stderr.log
  prevent output (dflt): /dev/null
- run "./support/aTV_jailbreak/uninstall.bash"
- run "./support/aTV_jailbreak/install.bash"
