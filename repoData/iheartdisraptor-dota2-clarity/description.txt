These are my Autohotkey settings for Dota 2. The main enhancement is to swap
CTRL and ALT because for some reason Dota 2 doesn't allow you to do so. This
script just contains key bindings; there are no game-breaking keyboard or mouse
macros inside.

This folder contains a history of cvarlists (console variables). This is useful
to detect when Valve adds new and useful console commands. This is how it works:

Every major patch, generate a new list of all the console variables using:

    cvarlist log cvarlist-log.txt

Use a diff program to generate the changes from one patch to another. Online
diff programs are available, e.g. http://www.diffchecker.com.

This folder contains various documentation on console commands.

Running this .reg will allow you to enter replay URLs into the Windows
run dialog (windows key + R) to have Dota 2 download the replay file.
A replay url is for example "dota2://matchid=459788526".

This folder contains code written to generate console commands for various
purposes. This is kept here for reference and development. You can safely
ignore this folder, but if you're curious how certain things are generated
(tower range circles, camp spawn boxes) you can look at the code.

2. Quick Installation
---------------------

If you don't already have an autoexec.cfg, installation is easy. Simply copy
the cfg/ and scripts/ folders to Steam/SteamApps/common/dota 2 beta/dota/.
This will install and enable the aliases and tutorials (the bindings and
console variables will not be enabled by default; you should browse those
and use the ones you like).

If you do have an autoexec.cfg, copy the cfg/clarity/ folder to
Steam/SteamApps/common/dota 2 beta/dota/cfg and the scripts/tutorial/
folder to Steam/SteamApps/common/dota 2 beta/dota/scripts. Then add the
following to your autoexec.cfg:

    con_enable 1
    exec clarity/use_tutorials_and_aliases.cfg

---
3. Detailed Installation
------------------------

The file structure is designed so that you can include only the parts of
dota2-clarity that you want to use and ignore the rest. This works by keeping
all files in Steam/SteamApps/common/dota 2 beta/dota/cfg/clarity and `exec`uting
them from your autoexec.cfg.

1. Copy the cfg/clarity/ folder to
   Steam/SteamApps/common/dota 2 beta/dota/cfg.
2. Copy the scripts/tutorial/ folder to
   Steam/SteamApps/common/dota 2 beta/dota/scripts.

To enable only training missions and aliases (recommended):

3. In your Steam/SteamApps/common/dota 2 beta/dota/cfg/autoexec.cfg file,
   add `exec clarity/use_tutorials_and_aliases.cfg`.
4. Restart Dota 2, open the console, and enter one of the commands to start
   a training mission:
   * `train_radiant_juke_paths`
   * `train_dire_juke_paths`
   * `train_pull_wards`
   * `train_rune_wards`
   * `train_vision_wards`

To enable only some features (recommended):

3. Open clarity/use_all.cfg and clarity/example_binds.cfg.
4. Copy and modify the lines for the features you want to use into your
   autoexec.cfg.

To enable all features (not recommended):

3. In your Steam/SteamApps/common/dota 2 beta/dota/cfg/autoexec.cfg file,
   add `exec clarity/use_all.cfg`.

---
4. Usage
--------

Explore the clarity/ directory and read the documentation in the files that
interest you. Of particular interest is clarity/example_binds.cfg, which defines
key bindings for aliases defined by Clarity.

To use practice drills:

1. Start a local game with cheats enabled.
2. Open the console and enter the command to start the drill you want to run,
   e.g. `drill_juke_paths`.
3. Press the apostrophe key to print cheat keys to the console.

To use training missions:

1. At the main interface without a game started, open the console and enter the
   command to start the tutorial, e.g. `drill_rune_wards`.
2. Press the apostrophe key to print cheat keys to the console.
