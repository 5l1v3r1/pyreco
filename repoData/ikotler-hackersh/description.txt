Hackersh
========

`Hackersh <http://www.hackersh.org>`_ ("Hacker Shell") is a shell (command interpreter) written in Python with Pythonect-like syntax, builtin security commands, and out of the box wrappers for various security tools.

Hello, world
------------

Here is the canonical "Hello, world" example program in Hackersh::

	"http://localhost" -> url -> nmap -> w3af

Wait, what? This is a a compacted but 100% complete implementation of a black-box web application vulnerability scanner

Installation
------------

There are a few ways to install Hackersh.

1. You can install directly from PyPI_ using ``easy_install`` or pip_::

        easy_install hackersh

   or::

        pip install hackersh

2. You can clone the git repository somewhere in your system::

        git clone git://github.com/ikotler/hackersh.git

   Then you should do following steps::

        cd hackersh
        python setup.py install

   Alternatively, if you use pip_, you can install directly from the git repository::

        pip install \
