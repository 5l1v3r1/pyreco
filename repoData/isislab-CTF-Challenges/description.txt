Description
Hi, I went where you told me. To that abandoned old shack in the middle of nowhere. And you where right: I dug left of the trail and found the cable you told me. (I cut it through with the shovel, accidently.)

In the cable there are 5 wires: A blank one and four wires in red isolation. They are marked with different dash codes. In total, I have the following wires to connect:

Away of the shack:

a0: blank wire
a1: isolated, no marks
a2: isolated, "dash, long pause"
a3: isolated, "dash, dash, long pause"
a4: isolated, "dash, dash, short pause"
To the shack:

b0: blank wire
b1: isolated, no marks
b2: isolated, "dash, long pause"
b3: isolated, "dash, dash, long pause"
b4: isolated, "dash, dash, short pause"
Differential probe:

probe1p: Positive terminal
probe1n: Negative terminal
I have many screw terminals, a huge supply of standard resistors and one digital differential probe. Now it's your job to tell me how to connect the wires to the diffprobe and to read the signals.

Input Format description:

Connection Lines: terminal1 terminal2 [resistance/Ohm] (resistance defaults to 0)
One empty Line
Injected Current Lines: time/s current/A
Example:

probe1p a0
probe1n b0
a1 b1 10

0.0 0.0
0.1 0.5

This connects the differential probe directly between the blank wires. Additionally the wire without marks are interconnected with 10 Ohm inbetween. There will be a current injected through the probes. The current will start at 0 and increase linearly to 0.5 Ampere after 100 milliseconds.

Update: A previous version of this challenge allowed multiple semi-functional probes. This has been fixed. There was no advantage due to this.

I heard rsync is a well-designed communications protocol so this one should be easy - even transfered the flag twice!
