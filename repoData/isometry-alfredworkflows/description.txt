# pipe workflow by isometry

A workflow for [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) to transform the currently selected text or the contents of the clipboard by passing it through an arbitrary shell one-liner.

## Requirements

- [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) (version 2.0+)
- The [Alfred Powerpack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/).
- [pipe.alfredworkflow](https://raw.github.com/isometry/alfredworkflows/master/pipe.alfredworkflow)

## Usage

(Optional) assign hotkeys for the two Hotkey handlers in the workflow. I recommend `Cmd+Shift+|` and `Cmd+Ctrl+\`, respectively.

Two actions are available, both taking an arbitrarily complex shell pipe as their argument:

1. triggered by the first hotkey or by the `|` or `pipe` keywords, will transform the clipboard in-place by passing its contents through the pipe given as argument.
2. triggered by the second hotkey, will transform the currently selected text in-place by passing its contents through the pipe given as argument.

A number of built-in pipelines are [included](https://raw.github.com/isometry/alfredworkflows/net.isometry.alfred.pipe/builtins.json), and custom aliases can also be defined with the following syntax:

`| alias NAME=PIPE | LINE@@`

`| alias tac=sed '1!G;h;$!d'@@`

# ssh workflow by isometry

A workflow for [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) to rapidly open a Secure SHell (ssh) sessions with smart hostname autocompletion based on the contents of `~/.ssh/known_hosts`, `~/.ssh/config`, `/etc/hosts` and (optionally) Bonjour.

![Example 1](https://raw.github.com/isometry/alfredworkflows/master/screenshots/ssh_local.png)

![Example 2](https://raw.github.com/isometry/alfredworkflows/master/screenshots/ssh_user@local.png)

## Requirements

- [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) (version 2.0+)
- The [Alfred Powerpack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/).
- [ssh.alfredworkflow](https://raw.github.com/isometry/alfredworkflows/master/ssh.alfredworkflow)
- (optional) [pybonjour](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pybonjour)

## Usage

Type `ssh` in Alfred followed by either a literal hostname or by some letters from the hostname of a host referenced in any of `~/.ssh/known_hosts`, `~/.ssh/config`, `/etc/hosts`, or (with `pybonjour` installed) Bonjour.

If you wish to use iTerm rather than Terminal.app, instructions for overriding the ssh protocol handler can be found [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/28938/set-iterm2-as-the-ssh-url-handler) and [here](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/826-ssh-with-smart-hostname-autocompletion/#entry4147)
