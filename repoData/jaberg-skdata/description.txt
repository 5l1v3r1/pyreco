This folder contains tiny example datasets that are so small, and so static,
that it is OK to check them directly into the git source repo.

Nothing larger than about 50K should be checked in here.


This folder contains small example images, they never change so it is not too
bad to check them into the git source repo. Pls don't add more images here
without very good reason.
