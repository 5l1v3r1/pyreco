Flask Sphinx Styles
===================

This repository contains sphinx styles for Flask and Flask related
projects.  To use this style in your Sphinx documentation, follow
this guide:

1. put this folder as _themes into your docs folder.  Alternatively
   you can also use git submodules to check out the contents there.
2. add this to your conf.py:

   sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('_themes'))
   html_theme_path = ['_themes']
   html_theme = 'flask'

The following themes exist:

- 'flask' - the standard flask documentation theme for large
  projects
- 'flask_small' - small one-page theme.  Intended to be used by
  very small addon libraries for flask.

The following options exist for the flask_small theme:

   [options]
   index_logo = ''              filename of a picture in _static
                                to be used as replacement for the
                                h1 in the index.rst file.
   index_logo_height = 120px    height of the index logo
   github_fork = ''             repository name on github for the
                                "fork me" badge

in Flask applications.

   $ easy_install Flask-MongoKit

.. _pip: http://pip.openplans.org/

Flask-MongoKit requires to run some packages (they will be installed automatically if they not already installed):

* pymongo

Changelog
=========

* **0.6 (08.07.2012)**

  * Use the new app context and again the old request context.
  * The MongoKit object is now subscriptable and support the typical syntax to 
    get a collection.::

        db['my_collection'].insert({'x': 5})

  * Restructured and improved test suite.
  * Sounds crazy but improved python2.5 support.

* **0.5 (02.07.2012)**

  * You don't need a request context anymore for the mongodb connection.
    (A bad decision ... look in 0.6)

* **0.4 (23.02.2012)**

  * Support new import system of flask. Use now::

      from flask.ext.mongokit import Mongokit
