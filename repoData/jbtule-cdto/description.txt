Finder Toolbar app to open the current directory in the Terminal (or iTerm, X11)

 * It's written in objective-c, and uses the scripting bridge so it's *fast*.
 * It's also shell agnostic. Works equally well when your shell is `bash` or `fish` or `tcsh`.

###Usage:

Download [Latest cdto.zip](https://github.com/jbtule/cdto/releases/latest)

To install "cd to.app" copy it from the appropriate sub-folder (iterm//x11_xterm/unsigned per your choice) to your Applications folder, and then from the applications folder drag it into the Finder toolbar (10.9 Mavericks requires ⌘ + ⌥) 

To use, just click on the new button and instanly opens a new terminal window.

For old versions to use with iTerm or X11/xterm, using the finder contextual menu "show package contents"  and exchange the plugins in the Plugin/Plugin Disabled folders respectively.  Next time you run  "cd to ..." it should open with the correct application.
