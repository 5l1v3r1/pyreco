# How to contribute

For `sandman` to be a truly great project, third-party code contributions are
critical. I (@jeffknupp) can only do so much, and I don't have the benefit of
working on `sandman` in a team, where multiple ideas and points-of-view would be
heard. So if you want to enhance `sandman`, spot and fix a bug, or just
generally want to get involved, I'd love the help! Below is a list of things
that might aid you in contributing to `sandman`.

## Getting Started

* Create a new, Python 2.7+ virtualenv and install the requirements via pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Either sumbit an issue directly on GitHub or head to `sandman's` [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/jeffknupp/sandman) page
  * For bugs, clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce
  * For enhancement proposals, be sure to indicate if you're willing to work on implementing the enhancement
* Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes

* `sandman` uses [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) as the git branching model
    * **No commits should be made directly to `master`** 
    * [Install git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) and create a `feature` branch like so: `$ git flow feature start <name of your feature>`
* Make commits of logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes. 
    * Test coverage is currently at 100% and tracked via [coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/r/jeffknupp/sandman?branch=develop)
    * Aim for 100% coverage on your code
        * If this is not possible, explain why in your commit message
        * This may be an indication that your code should be refactored
    * If you're creating a totaly new feature, create a new class in `test_sandmand.py` that inherits from `TestSandmanBase`
* Run `python setup.py test` to make sure your tests pass
* Run `coverage run --source=sandman setup.py test` if you have the `coverage` package installed to generate coverage data
* Check your coverage by running `coverage report`

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to the feature branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the main repository

Documentation

[Sandman documentation](https://sandman.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

`sandman` "makes things REST". Have an existing database you'd like to expose via
a REST API? Normally, you'd have to write a ton of boilerplate code for
the ORM you're using, then integrate that into some web framework. 

I don't want to write boilerplate.

Here's what's required to create a RESTful API service from an existing database using
`sandman`:

```bash
$ sandmanctl sqlite:////tmp/my_database.db
```

*That's it.* `sandman` will then do the following:

* connect to your database and introspect its contents
* create and launch a REST API service
* create an HTML admin interface
* *open your browser to the admin interface*

That's right. Given a legacy database, `sandman` not only gives you a REST API,
it gives you a beautiful admin page and *opens your browser to the admin page*.
It truly does everything for you.

Supported Databases
------------------

`sandman`, by default, supports connections to the same set of databases as
[SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org). As of this writing, that includes:

* MySQL (MariaDB)
* PostgreSQL
* SQLite
* Oracle
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Firebird
* Drizzle
* Sybase
* IBM DB2
* SAP Sybase SQL Anywhere
* MonetDB

Authentication
--------------

As of version 0.9.3, `sandman` fully supports HTTP Basic Authentication! See the
documentation for more details.

Behind the Scenes
-----------------

`sandmanctl` is really just a simple wrapper around the following:

```python
from sandman import app

app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///chinook'

from sandman.model import activate

activate()

app.run()
```

**You don't even need to tell `sandman` what tables your database contains.** 
Just point `sandman` at your database and let it do all the heavy lifting

Let's start our new service and make a request. While we're at it, lets make use
of `sandman`'s awesome filtering capability by specifying a filter term:

```zsh
> python runserver.py &
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

> curl GET "http://localhost:5000/artists?Name=AC/DC"
```

```json
...
{
    "resources": [
        {
            "ArtistId": 1,
            "Name": "AC/DC",
            "links": [
                {
                    "rel": "self",
                    "uri": "/artists/1"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

All of that, including filtering/searching, is automagically available from
those *five* measly lines of code.

Oh, that's not enough? You also want a Django-style admin interface built
automatically? Fine. You may have noticed that when you ran `runserver.py` that
a browser window popped up. Now's the time to go check that out. You'll find
it's that Django-style admin interface you've been bugging me about, looking
something like this:

![admin interface awesomesauce screenshot](http://sandman.io/static/img/admin_small.jpg)

----

(If you want to disable the browser from opening automatically each time `sandman`
starts, call `activate` with `browser=False`)

If you wanted to specify specific tables that `sandman` should make available,
how do you do that? With this little ditty:

```python
from sandman.model import register, Model

class Artist(Model):
    __tablename__ = 'Artist'

class Album(Model):
    __tablename__ = 'Album'

class Playlist(Model):
    __tablename__ = 'Playlist'

register((Artist, Album, Playlist))
```

And if you wanted to add custom logic for an endpoint? Or change the endpoint
name? Or add validation? All supported. Here's a "fancy" class definition:

```python
class Style(Model):
    """Model mapped to the "Genre" table

    Has a custom endpoint ("styles" rather than the default, "genres").
    Only supports HTTP methods specified.
    Has a custom validator for the GET method.

    """

    __tablename__ = 'Genre'
    __endpoint__ = 'styles'
    __methods__ = ('GET', 'DELETE')

    @staticmethod
    def validate_GET(resource=None):
        """Return False if the request should not be processed.

        :param resource: resource related to current request
        :type resource: :class:`sandman.model.Model` or None

        """

        if isinstance(resource, list):
            return True
        elif resource and resource.GenreId == 1:
            return False
        return True
```

With `sandman`, zero boilerplate code is required. In fact, using `sandmanctl`,
**no code is required at all**. Your existing database
structure and schema is introspected and your database tables magically get a
RESTful API and admin interface. For each table, `sandman` creates:

* proper endpoints 
* support for a configurable set of HTTP verbs 
    * GET
    * POST
    * PATCH
    * PUT
    * DELETE
* responses with appropriate `rel` links automatically
  * foreign keys in your tables are represented by link
* custom validation by simply defining `validate_<METHOD>` methods on your Model
* explicitly list supported methods for a Model by setting the `__methods__` attribute
* customize a Models endpoint by setting the `__endpoint__` method
* essentially a HATEOAS-based service sitting in front of your database

`sandman` is under active development but should be usable in any environment due
to one simple fact:

**`sandman` never alters your database unless you add or change a record yourself.  It adds no extra tables to your existing database and requires no changes to any of your existing tables. If you start `sandman`, use it to browse your database via cURL, then stop `sandman`, your database will be in exactly the same state as it was before you began.** 

### Installation

`pip install sandman`

### Example Application

Take a look in the `sandman/test` directory. The application found there makes
use of the [Chinook](http://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com) sample SQL database.

# Changelog

## Version 0.9.6

* Support for using existing declarative models alongside `sandman` generated models
    * If you have an existing app and want to include sandman in it, simply pass
      your existing models in to the `register()` function along with any
      `sanmdman` generated classes. `sandman` will detect the existing models
      and augment them.

## Version 0.9.5

* Fixes a critical bug where code used by the new `etag` decorators was
  accidentally not included. Thanks to @mietek for the PR.
* Fixes an issue when showing the HTML representation of an empty collection.
* Thanks to @mietek for reporting the issue.

## Version 0.9.4

* Fixes a critical bug in the requirements portion of `setup.py`, adding `Flask-HTTPAuth`

## Version 0.9.3

* Authentication supported!
    * Entire API and admin can be protected by HTTP Basic Auth. See the docs for
      more details.
* ETAGs
    * Resources return the proper ETAG header and should reply with a 304 after
      the first request. This greatly improves the throughput and performance of
      the API.

## Version 0.9.2

* The `meta` endpoint
    * All resources now have a `/<resource>/meta` endpoint that describes the
      types of each of their fields (both in HTML and JSON) 
* The root endpoint
    * A "root" endpoint (`/`) has been created. It lists all resources
      registered in the application and includes URLs to their various
      endpoints. This allows a "dumb" client to navigate the API without knowing
      URLs beforehand.

## Version 0.9.1

* Python 3 support!
    * `sandman` tests now pass for both 2.7 and 3.4! Python 3.4 is officially supported.

## Version 0.8.1

### New Feature

* `Link` header now set to a resource's links
    * Links to related objects now user a proper `rel` value: `related`
    * The link to the current resource still uses the `self` `rel` value
    * Links are specified both in the header (as per RFC5988) and in the
      resource itself
* Pagination added for JSON (and number of results per page being returned is fixed)
* Nested JSON models no longer the default; hitting a URL with the argument "expand"
  will show one level of nested resources
    * This conforms more closely to REST principles while not sacrificing the
      functionality. 


## Version 0.7.8

### Bug Fixes

* Fix multiple references to same table error (fixes #59)
