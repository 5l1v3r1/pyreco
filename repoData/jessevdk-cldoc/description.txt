# cldoc documentation example

This documentation example shows many of the features of
[cldoc](http://jessevdk.github.com/cldoc) and provides
a complete working example of how to document your code and generate a website
using [cldoc](http://jessevdk.github.com/cldoc).

The source for this example can be found in the
[cldoc repository](https://github.com/jessevdk/cldoc/tree/master/example) on github.

#<cldoc:transport>

The transport namespace.

The transport namespace contains various classes used for transportation. This
namespace contains only the *best* types of transportation (i.e. bycicles).
Please have a look at the base <Bicycle> class. If you are more interested
in cycling on the road, you can check out the <RacingBike> class. If you're
more of an offroad type of person then a <MountainBike> might be more for you.

#<cldoc:Tutorial>

Tutorial category example.

# Example category
This is an example of a category file. You can create as many categories and
subcategories as you want. Categories can also appear under other symbols
such as namespaces.

#<cldoc:Tutorial::Using transport>

Using the transport library.

This could describe how the transport library works

#<cldoc:Tutorial::Getting on your bike>

How to get on your bike.

Describes how you can get on your bike.

# Simple example project
This directory contains a simple example project to demonstrate how cldoc
can be used. The provided Makefile will by default just built a simple shared
library. The documentation for this library can be generated with `make doc`,
which will write the generated website in the `html/` directory. Use
`make serve` to open the website.

cldoc is a clang based documentation generator for C and C++. cldoc tries to
solve the issue of writing C/C++ software documentation with a modern,
non-intrusive and robust approach.

# Features
* Uses clang to robustly parse even the most complex C++ projects without
  additional effort from the user.
* Requires zero configuration.
* Uses markdown for documentation formatting.
* Generates an xml description of the API which can be reused for other purposes.
* Uses a simple format for documenting your code.
* Supports cross-referencing in documentation.
* Generates a single file, javascript based web application to render the documentation.
* Integrates seamlessly with your existing website.
* Lightning fast client-side searching using a pregenerated search index.
* Generates a formatted documentation coverage report and integrates it in the
  website.

# Get started now!
To get started using cldoc, please have a look at
[Getting started](http://jessevdk.github.com/cldoc/gettingstarted.html) to install cldoc. Then explore how
to [document your code](http://jessevdk.github.com/cldoc/documenting.html) so that cldoc can extract it. Finally
go and read [Generating site](http://jessevdk.github.com/cldoc/generating.html) to find out how to use the cldoc
command in your project to generate the documentation.

# Example
For an easy introduction into using cldoc, please have a look at the
[example project](https://github.com/jessevdk/cldoc/tree/master/example) and corresponding
generated [documentation](http://jessevdk.github.com/cldoc/example/).
