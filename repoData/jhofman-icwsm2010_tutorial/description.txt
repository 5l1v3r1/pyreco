Code for presented network examples.

toygraph.edgelist contains a directed edgelist for the example graph,
a visualization of which is given in toygraph.png (generated from
toygraph.dot with graphviz).

To run:

   ./run_toygraph

This will convert the edgelist to an adjacency list, generate the
degree distribution, calculate the number of clustering coefficient
and one/two-hop neighborhood sizes, and perform breadth-first
search. (Note: clustering coefficient computes number of closed,
out-bound triangles that each node belongs to.)

All examples run locally, but can be run using Hadoop streaming on
large input, e.g.:

      cat toygraph.edgelist | ./adjacency_list.py -l > toygraph.adjlist

can be run on Hadoop as:

    $HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop jar $HADOOP_HOME/contrib/streaming/hadoop-*-streaming.jar \
	-input toygraph.edgelist \
	-output toygraph.adjlist \
	-mapper "adjacency_list.py -m" \
	-reducer "adjacency_list.py -r" \
	-file adjacency_list.py \
	-file hstream.py

where $HADOOP_HOME points to your Hadoop install.

This repository contains example code for the tutorial I presented at
ICWSM 2010, "Large-scale social media analysis with Hadoop". More

  wordcount/ contains the wordcount example on small input text
  network/ contains network examples on a small toygraph
  hstream.py is a simple class for implementing streaming jobs

Examples can be run locally, using the "cat data | map | sort |
reduce" analog of Hadoop streaming, or with Hadoop streaming.

To install Hadoop locally, just download and untar the source.

in mind.

The obligatory wordcount example for an introduction to mapreduce,
implemented in hadoop streaming using a simple wrapper class
(hstream). Counts the number of times each word in the input occurs.

To run locally:

   ./run_wordcount

To run with Hadoop:

   ./run_wordcount -h
