Missing pieces
---------------
We don't have a real changelog from before november 2013.


Summer 2011, somewher.
----------------------
- First initial, working version.

deployer.contrib
================

This contrib directory contains example code which may be useful for many. Is
is meant to be a demonstration of good practices and posibilities, but it is
as well as a libary of reusable code.

However, note that you don't have to use anything from the contrib directory.
Right now, contrib expects the hosts to be a debian based system and
deployment scripts for other operating systems may be entirely different.

Deployer
========

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/jonathanslenders/python-deployer/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/jonathanslenders/python-deployer/latest)

Framework for remote execution on Posix systems.

Important key features are:

 - Powerful interactive command line with autocompletion;
 - Interactive and fast parallel execution;
 - Reusability of your code (through inheritance);
 - Normally using SSH for remote execution, but pluggable for other execution methods.

It's more powerful than `Fabric`_, but different from `Saltstack`_. It's not
meant to replace anything, it's another tool for your toolbox.

History
-------

During the summer of 2011, when I was unsatisfied with some of the capabilities
of Fabric, I (Jonathan) started the development of a new, interactive
deployment system from scratch. The first successful deployments (of a Django
project) were done only a few months later, but since then, all the code has
been refactored quite a few times.
