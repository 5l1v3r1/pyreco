krTheme Sphinx Style
====================

This repository contains sphinx styles Kenneth Reitz uses in most of 
his projects. It is a drivative of Mitsuhiko's themes for Flask and Flask related
projects.  To use this style in your Sphinx documentation, follow
this guide:

1. put this folder as _themes into your docs folder.  Alternatively
   you can also use git submodules to check out the contents there.

2. add this to your conf.py: ::

	sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('_themes'))
	html_theme_path = ['_themes']
	html_theme = 'flask'

The following themes exist:

**kr**
	the standard flask documentation theme for large projects

**kr_small**
	small one-page theme.  Intended to be used by very small addon libraries.
