krTheme Sphinx Style
====================

This repository contains sphinx styles Kenneth Reitz uses in most of 
his projects. It is a derivative of Mitsuhiko's themes for Flask and Flask related
projects.  To use this style in your Sphinx documentation, follow
this guide:

1. put this folder as _themes into your docs folder.  Alternatively
   you can also use git submodules to check out the contents there.

2. add this to your :file:`conf.py`: ::

	sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('_themes'))
	html_theme_path = ['_themes']
	html_theme = 'flask'

The following themes exist:

**kr**
	the standard flask documentation theme for large projects

**kr_small**
	small one-page theme.  Intended to be used by very small addon libraries.

Topics include:

- Platform- and version-specific installations
- Py2app, Py2exe, bbfreeze, pyInstaller
- Pip
- Virtualenv
- fabric
- Exhaustive module recommendations, grouped by topic/purpose
- Which libraries to use for what
- Server configurations & tools for various web frameworks
- Documentation: writing it
- Testing: Jenkins & tox guides
- How to easily interface ``hg`` from ``git`` easily

If you aren't fond of reading reStructuredText, there is an
almost up-to-date `HTML version at docs.python-guide.org
<http://docs.python-guide.org>`_.
