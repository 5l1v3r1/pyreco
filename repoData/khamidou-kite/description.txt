## Kite UI mini-spec

This is a very very high-level view of what Kite should look like. 

### Personas

There's two personas for this app.

Joe is an ubuntu nerd. He likes to dabble with his home linux server. He's thoughtful about privacy.

Sarah is Joe's mother. She uses email mostly to communicate with her family and to get groupon offers. 
 
### Home page

This is what you see after logging-in.

Emails are grouped by subjects.

### Thread view

If you click on a thread from the compose window, you get taken to the thread view. It shows all the emails in a thread.

There's a compose window at the to reply to the latest email in the thread.
Additionally, some magic javascript polls the server regularly and displays a notification if there's some new mail in the thread. 

## Kite, a modern webmail

Kite is a webmail designed to look a lot like gmail and to be easily deployable on a single server.
It's written in Javascript with Angularjs for the frontend, and in Python 2 for the backend.

This is very much alpha software, but I hope to have something usable in a couple months.

You can see a demo [here](http://kiteapp.io/app).

### How to run it

To run it, you'll need to have [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) installed.
When it's done, run:

    vagrant up

After this, browse to http://192.168.50.4 . You should be greeted by a login window. Use whatever username/password combination to login.

The host name of the vagrant box is kitebox.dev. You should probably add it to
your (host) machine /etc/hosts.

### Contact/Help
