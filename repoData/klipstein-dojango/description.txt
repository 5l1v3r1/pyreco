This directory contains some helpers for running dojango on appengine.

memcache_zipserve.py:

  Part of http://code.google.com/p/google-app-engine-samples/: 
  Using zipserve to serve the media-files. After the first use they'll be 
  cached in memcache. Modified to support last-modified-headers (so we have 
  a real CDN!)

dojo_serve.py:
  
  Helper for serving the whole dojo release folder, that holds the dojo
  modules as zipfiles.
  It can be used within app.yaml (AppEngine configuration file) like this:

      - url: /dojango/media/release/.*
        script: dojango/appengine/dojo_serve.py

  Afterwards all zip-files within /dojango/media/release/DOJANGO_DOJO_VERSION/
  will be served and cached.

Dojango is a reusable django application that helps you to use the client-side
framework dojo within your django project. It provides capabilites to easily 
switch between several dojo versions and sources (e.g. aol, google, local) and 
delivers helping utilities, that makes the development of rich internet 
applications in combination with dojo more comfortable. Also it makes the building 
of your own packed dojo release easier. Another goal of this project is, that you 
can learn how you have to structure your html to use dojo within your projects.
