Flask Sphinx Styles
===================

This repository contains sphinx styles for Flask and Flask related
projects.  To use this style in your Sphinx documentation, follow
this guide:

1. put this folder as _themes into your docs folder.  Alternatively
   you can also use git submodules to check out the contents there.
2. add this to your conf.py:

   sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('_themes'))
   html_theme_path = ['_themes']
   html_theme = 'flask'

The following themes exist:

- 'flask' - the standard flask documentation theme for large
  projects
- 'flask_small' - small one-page theme.  Intended to be used by
  very small addon libraries for flask.

The following options exist for the flask_small theme:

   [options]
   index_logo = ''              filename of a picture in _static
                                to be used as replacement for the
                                h1 in the index.rst file.
   index_logo_height = 120px    height of the index logo
   github_fork = ''             repository name on github for the
                                "fork me" badge

    ~ How do I use it?

      1. Install the required libraries, preferably using pip and virtualenv:
	i. Download `pip` and `virtualenv`
	    $ sudo easy_install pip
	    $ sudo pip install virtualenv
	ii. Create an isolated environment with `virtualenv`:
	    $ virtualenv --no-site-packages env
	    $ source env/bin/activate
	iii. Install dependencies with `pip`:
	    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

      2. fire up a python shell and run the flaskr.py file
         with your python interpreter and the application will
         greet you on http://localhost:5000/
	$ python flaskr.py 
	
    ~ Is it tested?

      You betcha.  Run the `flaskr_tests.py` file to see
      the tests pass.
