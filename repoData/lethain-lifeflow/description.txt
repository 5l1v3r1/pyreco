* Demo: particletree.com/features/rediscovering-the-button-element

* Created by Kevin Hale [particletree.com]

Usage
----------------------------------------------------------------

1) Add this line to "blueprint/screen.css":
	 @import 'plugins/buttons/buttons.css';

2) Use the following HTML code to place the buttons on your site:

	<button type="submit" class="button positive">
	  <img src="css/blueprint/plugins/buttons/icons/tick.png" alt=""/> Save
	</button>

	<a class="button" href="/password/reset/">
	  <img src="css/blueprint/plugins/buttons/icons/key.png" alt=""/> Change Password
	</a>

	<a href="#" class="button negative">
	  <img src="css/blueprint/plugins/buttons/icons/cross.png" alt=""/> Cancel
	</a>

CSS Development Classes Plugin

Sets up some classes to use in CSS development

This is an experimental plugin, and the tools it provides
are not exactly semantically correct, so use with care,
and preferably only in development. :)


Usage
----------------------------------------------------------------

1) Add this line to "blueprint/screen.css", and you're done:
	 @import 'plugins/css-classes/css-classes.css';

Fancy Type
* Gives you classes to use if you'd like some 
  extra fancy typography. 

Credits and instructions are specified above each class
in the fancy-type.css file in this directory.


Usage
----------------------------------------------------------------

1) Add this line to "blueprint/screen.css", and you're done:
	 @import 'plugins/fancy-type/fancy-type-compressed.css';

Note that this uses the compressed version of the CSS file, 
as the original file contains a lot of instructing comments.

Remember to re-compress (or change) the compressed file 
if you make any changes to the original CSS file.

Here's a pretty good CSS compressor:
