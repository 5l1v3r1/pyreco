Uliweb Change Log
=====================

0.3.1 Version
-----------------

* Add qqmail mail server backend support, thanks to Yubin Wang <harry198344 AT gmail.com>

0.3 Version
-----------------

* Fix pyini "key=" for raw output bug
* Fix objcache for Lazy field bug, it'll refresh first if found Lazy field
* Fix executing orm command raise Exception not be thrown bug
* Refact multidb support
* Change UserWarn to DeprecationWarning
* Fix syncdb for different table name between `Model.__tablename__` and settings bug
* Remove `get_cached()` and add `cache` parameter to `Model.get()`
* Add `get_local_cache()` and `clear_local_cache()` in order to compatiable
  with SimpleFrame implementation
* ORM `Property.to_str()` will return string but not unicode for CHAR and VARCHAR.
* Simplify server_default, if integer given, it'll be convert to `text(n)`
* `ManyResult.all()` can receive a `cache` parameter
* Improve `dump()` and `load()`, add PickleType , ManyToMany support
* Refact objcache app implementation and add `exclude` config option
* Remove primary_key detect, because multi primary_key columns can make composite primary key,
  add partition support for mysql

  you can define:

    ```
    __table_args__ = {
        'mysql_partition_by':'HASH(YEAR(create_time))',
        'mysql_partitions': '6'
    }
    ```
* add None patch process, you can set '', 'empty, 'exception'.
* move uliweb/orm/middle*.py to uliweb/contrib/orm
* move uliweb/i18n/middle_i18n.py to uliweb/contrib/i18n
* move storage from core to utils directory
* improve count process
* Fix Reference and ManyToMany dump and load bug

* Add version check to redis_cli APP, default is disabled
* Add `clear_table()` to objcache APP
* Add 'id' parameter to `get()` and `get_object()` and `get_cached_object()` functions,
  so that if the ID can't be found in cache, condition (old parameter) will be used.
  And when id and condition given both, only when id is not integer or valid expression
  condition will be used. So in most cases, you don't need pass condition.

* Add settings and local_settings env variables support
* Fix count bug
* Change orm requirement.txt, add uliweb-alembic package

    ```
    user_id = Field(int, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    ```
* Fix sqldot bug and improve sqlhtml generation
* Eanble colored log output by default.
* Add recorder app, you can use it to record the visit url, and test it later

0.2.5 Version
-----------------

* Fix config template and add `uwsgi` shell support
* Add environment variables support in `settings.ini`. For example, there is a 
  `MYSQL_PORT` defined in environment, so you can defined something in settings.ini:

    ```
    [DEFAULT]
    port = $MYSQL_PORT
    port_str = '${MYSQL_PORT}'
    ```
    
    `$MYSQL_PORT` is the same as `${MYSQL_PORT}`. Just when the variable follows
    identifier, so `${}` can easily separate between them.
* Add `STATIC_COMBINE_CONFIG` configuration, you can toggle static combination with it.
  Default is False. The configuration is:

    ```
    [STATIC_COMBINE_CONFIG]
    enabled = False
    ```
* Fix objcache app bug, if not fields defined in settings, it'll use all columns of table
* Add `get_table` function to `functions`, you can use it to get table object. Used
  in `uliweb.contrib.tables` app.
* Add `local_cache` to local in SimpleFrame, and it can be used to store require relative
  cache values, and it'll be empty after each require process.
* Improve `get_object()` function in ORM, add `use_local` parameter, so the cached
  value will be checked in `local_cache` first, and also save it in local_cache when 
  get a value from cache or database.
* Improve objcache config format, you can also define table like this:

    ```
    user = {'fields':['username'], 'expire':expire_time, 'key':callable(instance)|key_field}
    #or
    user = ['username', 'nickname']
    #or
    user = 
    ```
    
    If no fields defined, it'll use all fields of Model. And if expire is 0 or
    not defined, it'll not expired at all.
    
    `key` will be used to replace `id`, if you want another key value, and it
    can be also a callable object, it'll receive an instance of Model parameter,
    so you can create any key value as you want.
* Add Optimistic Concurrency Control support for ORM, so you should defined `version`
  Field first in Model, then when you save the object, you should use:

    ```
    obj.save(occ=True)
    ```
    
    If there is already other operation saved the record, it'll raise an `SaveError`
    Exception by default, because the version has been changed. You can also pass:
    
    * `occ_fieldname` used to defined the version fieldname, default is `version`
    * `occ_exception` used to enabled Exception raised, default is `True`, if you 
      set it `False` it'll return False, but not raise an Exception.

0.2.4 Version
-----------------

* Fix ORM is not compatible with SQLAlchemy 0.9.1. Old style:

    ```
    cond = None
    cond = (Blog.c.id==5) & None
    ```
    
    will not right in 0.9.1, because None will not be skipped, so you can change
    above code `cond = None` to :
    
    ```
    from sqlalchemy.sql import true
    cond = true()
    ``` 
    
    or
    
    ```
    from uliweb.orm import true
    cond = true()
    ```
    
* add `__contains__` to functions, so you can test if an API is already defined, just
  use:

    ```
    'flash' in functions
    ```
* Refact generic.py, remove `functions.flash` and `functions.get_fileserving` dependencies by default. 

* Fix `yield` support in view function, you can also used in gevent environment, for example:

    ```
    @expose('/test')
    def test():
        yield "<ul>"
        for i in range(10):
            yield "<li>%d</li>" % (i + 1)
            sleep(1)
        yield "</ul>"
    ```

* Fix `rawsql()` bug for different database engine
* Fix `jsonp()` dumps Chinese characters bug
* Add `trim_path()` function to `utils/common.py`, it can trim a file path to 
  limited length, for example:

    ```
    >>> a = '/project/apps/default/settings.ini'
    >>> trim_path(a, 30)
    '.../apps/default/settings.ini'
    ```
    
    Default limited length is 30.
* Add ORM connection information output when given `-v` option in command line. And
  the password will be replace with `'*'`. For example:

    ```
    $>uliweb syncdb -v
    Connection : mysql://blog:***@localhost/blog?charset=utf8
    
    [default] Creating [1/1, blog] blog...EXISTED
    ```
* Add multiple apps support for `makeapp` command, so you can use :

    ```
    uliweb makeapp a b c
    ```
    
    to create `a`, `b`, `c` apps at once time.
* Refactor `save_file()` process, add `headers` and `convertors` parameter.

    `headers` used to create csv header instead of using column name, but you can
    create alias name like this:
    
    ```
    User.c.username.label(u"Name")
    ```
    
    and `convertors` used to convert column value, for example:
    
    ```
    def name(value, data):
        """
        value is the column value
        data is the current record object
        """
        return value + 'test'
    save_file(do_(select([User.c.name])), 'test.csv', convertors={'name':name})
    ```

  will be surrounded by comment code just like:

    ```
    <!-- BLOCK title (apps/theme/templates/theme/skeleton.html) -->
    <!-- END title -->
    ```
    
  But this output may breaks template output, so make sure you just use it in debug mode.

  define your own config file structure to support this command in apps. Just set `template_files/config`, 
  and write `xxxxx.conf` and even `xxxxx.ini`, in `xxxxx.ini` you can set variables
  and default values which used in `xxxxx.conf`. So `xxxxx.conf` can have template
  variables.
* Improve `support` command, also support file structure defined under apps.
* Fix template normcase bug, changed to normpath.
* Refactor ORM Reference, OneToOne, ManyToMany init process, it'll be lazy initialized, and
  you should use get_model to get the Model. Because of lazy process, when two

  properties will not assigned to reference class like before, you should use
  get_model to get those models.

    [ORM]
    TABLENAME_CONVERTER = 'uliweb.utils.common.camel_to_'
    ```

  Then if the Model name is CamelCase then it'll be converted to `camel_case`.
* Add Reference, OneToOne, ManyToMany relation definition in Model level
* If collection_name is None, and if there is already `tablename_set` existed,
  then it'll create new collection_name automatically, so that the collection_name
  will not be duplication at all. But if the user pass the collection_name, and
  if there is `tablename_set` already, then raise the Exception always. Please note
  the difference about it.

* Refactor form, add build propert and function to Form class, and the result
   should be: pre_html, begin, body, buttons, end, post_html
* Add default parameter to uliweb/utils/common.py get_choice()
* Improve template extend and include process, if you extend the same filename
   with current filename, then it'll find the parent same named filename. This
   way can make new same named filename but extended from parent. Also support
   include tag.
* Add APP_LAYOUT support in uliweb.contrib.template, so in your template you can
   use: `{{use layout_template}}` in your tmplate, and config the app layout template
   as:

        [APP_LAYOUTS]
        appname = 'layout.html'

   so when render the template, the `layout_template` will be replaced with `layout.html`
* Add QueryString and query_string support in common.py
* Fix dispatch signal process bug
* Set werkzeug log level to 'info', #issue 2
* Improve template_layout.py checkbox creation
* Change wsgi_staticfiles apps order, later defined app will be processed earlier
* Refactor manage.py add call() function, add -f option to makeproject and makeapp
* Add test_cache.py test file.
* Add creator parameter to cache.get() and also support callable for value
* Add memcache storage support, and add inc(), dec() to cache
* Refactor require_login, remove has_login, require_login will raise Redirect Exception
   so you don't need to just return value
* Change Redirect to RedirectException, and redefine Redirect as function
* Fix soap configure reading bug
* Fix log format bug
* Fix pysimplesoap bool type bug http://code.google.com/p/pysimplesoap/issues/attachmentText?id=69&aid=690001000&name=simplexml.py.patch&token=F8TXcyAoCDS5vScp5MiFEccN6J4%3A1345507177742

0.1.3 Version
-----------------

* Fix loadtable bug for PickleType type, using inspecttable instead, so
   PickleyType will be BLOB type.
* Improve template process:

    * Add `#uliweb-template-tag:<begin_tag>,<end_tag><newline>` process to template
       file, and you can also pass `begin_tag` and `end_tag` to Template, and
       `template_file()` or `template()`
    * Add `[TEMPLATE_PROCESSOR]` section to `default_settings.ini`, so that user
       can setup his own template processor, the option will look like:

            angularjs_template = {'file_exts':['.ahtml'],
                'processor':'uliweb.core.template.template_file',
                'args':{}}

       * the key is not very important, but you should keep it unique
       * `file_exts` will be the file extensions, it's a list, so the
         processor can match multiple filenames
       * `processor` will be the path of template function, uliweb will
         import it when needed
       * `args` will be a dict, and it will be passed to template function
    * Add `BEGIN_TAG` and `END_TAG` to settings.ini, so user can change
       default tag name from `{{` and `}}` to other strings. But this
       appoach will effect globally, so if you are using other apps with
       templates which using old tag strings, will cause errors. So using
       `#uliweb-template-tag` or `TEMPLATE_PROCESSOR` maybe the good way,
       but you still need to set it in template file or set `response.template`
       with other template extension, because the defult template file extension
       is `.html`. For example:

            def index():
                response.template = 'index.ahtml'
                return {}

       Above code will override the default template filename from `index.html`
       to `index.ahtml`.
* Add Redirect support. Redirect is an exception, and also add Redirect support
   in middle_session. Because Redirect is an exception, so it'll implement process_exception
   and save the session also.
* Fix generic.py fields_convert_map initialization bug
* Fix template get_text() bug, add inherit_tags parameter to it, and if it's False,
   will use default begin and end tag string.
* Fix file_serving.download() for Chinese characters bug.
* Change the order of creating table colums according the definition of Model
* Fix pyini/uni_prt bug. And change _uni_prt to uni_prt.
* Add object() to ListView
* Upgrade pysimplesoap to 1.05a

0.1.2 Version
-----------------

* Fix permission tag, and change PERMISSION definitions in settings.ini, now the
   PERMISSION definition can use dict datatype, just like:

    ```
    [PERMISSION]
    PERM = {'name':'PERM', 'roles':['a', 'b'], 'description':'PERM}
    ```

   and with this method, you don't need to define ROLES_PERMISSIONS section
* Add TransactionMiddle as default settings in ORM settings.ini. By default, if
   you add 'uliweb.contrib.orm', the transaction middleware will automatically
   enabled. In the previous version, you should add this middleware yourself.
* Add app arguments to exportstatic command
* Remove --with-static option of export command, so default behavior is export
   static folder
* Fix default file_serving process, add x_filename process, in order to make
   alt filename support processing correctly.
* Add -m option to find command, so you can use:

    ```
    uliweb find -m model_name
    ```

   to find the model is defined in which model
* Add manytomany parameter to Model.delete() function, so it'll automatically
   delete manytomany relationships.
* Add tables app to uliweb.
* Add GenericReference and GenericRalation support
* Add BigIntegerProperty support, the shorthand is Field(BIGINT)
* Add `__pk_type__` variable, current is 'int', others will be 'biginteger',
   you can use set_pk_type(name) to switch it, also add PKTYPE() function, you
   can use Field(PKTYPE()) to create ForeignKey Property according the option,
   in web project, you can swith it via ORM/PK_TYPE
* Add delete_fieldname parameter to Model.delete(), so if you pass True, it'll
   assume the delete_fieldname is 'deleted', and if you pass real field_name it'll
   use it directly. This way will not delete the record at all, just change the
   delete_fieldname value from False to True.
* Fix RemoteField default datatype as int and default value is None.
* Refactor the ReferenceProperty datatype process.
* Add _class and id parameter to Form, and fix form_class process
* Refactor template, add BaseBlockNode class, and add end() process for block type node.

0.1.1 Version
-----------------

* Add BAE(Baidu Application Engine) and Heroku support

0.0.1 Version
-----------------

* Support i18n language setting key in query_string, and you can also configure
   keyword in settings.ini.

Uliweb Introduction
=====================

Limodou <limodou@gmail.com>

## About Uliweb

Uliweb is a full-stacked Python based web framework. It has three main design 
goals, they are: reusability, configurability, and replaceability. All the 
functionalities revolve around these goals. 

This project was created and lead by Limodou <mailto:limodou@gmail.com>. 


## License

Uliweb is released under BSD license.

## Infrastructure

Uliweb was not created totally from scratch. It uses some modules created by
other developers, for example:


* [Werkzeug](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/) Used to handle core processes in the framework.
    For example: URL Mapping, Debug, Request, Response, etc.
* [SqlAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org) The ORM based on it. Developers can access
    databases, or use the module separately.

I also referenced some code from other web frameworks, for example:


* The Templating system is styled after the one used in [web2py](http://mdp.cti.depaul.edu/) several
    improvements were made.
* Some code inspired from Django.

I also constructed a few new "wheels" myself. For example:

* Form processing module. Developers can use it to create HTML code, validate submitted data and
    convert submitted data to Python data types.
* I18n processing including template support, language lazy process.
* Cache & Session modules.
* Uliorm, which is an ORM module, was built on top of SqlAlchemy. I also referenced from
    GAE datastore module.
* Framework runtime process.
* Plugin mechanism, styled after the one used in the [UliPad](http://code.google.com/p/ulipad) project.

## Features

* Project Organization

    * MVT(Model View Template) development model.
    * Distributed development but unified management. Uliweb organizes a project with
        small apps. Each app can have its own configuration file(settings.ini), template
        directory, and static directory. Existing apps can be easily reused, but are treated as a compound.
        web application project if configured as such. Developers can also
        reference static files and templates between apps, thus easing inter-application data exchange.
        All apps in a project are loaded by default if INSTALLED_APPS is not configured in
        the configuration file. All separate app configuration files are automatically processed at
        project startup.

* URL Mapping

    * Flexiable and powerful URL mapping. Uliweb uses werkzeug's routing module.
        User can easily define a URL, which in turn can be easily bound with a view function.
        URLs can also be created reversely according to the view function name. It supports
        argument definitions in URLs and default URL mapping to a
        view function.

* View and Template

    * View templates can be automatically applied. If you return a dict variable from
        view function, Uliweb will automatically try to match and apply a template according
        to the view function name.
    * Environment execution mode. Each view function will be run in an environment,
        which eliminates the need to write many import statements. Plus there are already many
        objects that can be used directly, for example: request, response, etc. This is DRY and saves a lot of coding
    * Developers can directly use Python code in a template, the Python code does not neede to be indented
        as long as a pass statement is added at the end of each code block.
        Uliweb also supports child template inclusion and inheritance.

* ORM

    * Uliorm is based on SQLAlchemy package, so you can use Model layer and SQL
        expression layer both.
    * Uliorm integrates with alembic package, you can use it to migirate database
        automatically.

* I18n

    * Can be used in python and template files.
    * Browser language and cookie settings are supported including automatic language switching.
    * Provides a command line tool that developers can use to extract .po files.
        This can happen either at the app level or project level process. It can automatically merge .pot files to existing
        .po files.

* Extension

    * Dispatch extension. This is a dispatch processing mechanism that utilizes different
        types of dispatch points. So you can write procedures to carry out
        special processes and bind them to these dispatch points. For example, database
        initicalization, I18n process initialization, etc.
    * middleware extension. It's similar to Djangos. You can configure it in configuration
        files. Each middleware can process the request and response objets.
    * Special function calls in the views module initial process. If you write a special
        function named `__begin__`, it'll be processed before any view function can be processed,
        this allows developers to do some module level processing at that point, for example:
        check the user authentication, etc.

* Command Line Tools

    * Creates project, creates apps, and include the basic essential directory 
        structure, files and code.
    * Export static files, you can export all available apps' static files to a
        special directory. Also supports css and js combinition and compress process.
    * Startup a development web server thats supports debugging and autoreload.
    * Apps can also have its own command line tools. For example: orm, auth, etc.

* Deployment

    * Supports mod_wsgi in Apache.
    * Supports uwsgi.

* Development

    * Provide a development server, and can be automatically reload when some
        module files are modified.
    * Enhanced debugging, you can check the error traceback, template debugging is also supported.

INTRODUCTION
============

RCSSmin is a CSS minifier.

The minifier is based on the semantics of the `YUI compressor`_\, which itself
is based on `the rule list by Isaac Schlueter`_\.

This module is a re-implementation aiming for speed instead of maximum
compression, so it can be used at runtime (rather than during a preprocessing
step). RCSSmin does syntactical compression only (removing spaces, comments
and possibly semicolons). It does not provide semantic compression (like
removing empty blocks, collapsing redundant properties etc). It does, however,
support various CSS hacks (by keeping them working as intended).

Here's a feature list:

- Strings are kept, except that escaped newlines are stripped
- Space/Comments before the very end or before various characters are
  stripped: ``:{});=>+],!`` (The colon (``:``) is a special case, a single
  space is kept if it's outside a ruleset.)
- Space/Comments at the very beginning or after various characters are
  stripped: ``{}(=:>+[,!``
- Optional space after unicode escapes is kept, resp. replaced by a simple
  space
- whitespaces inside ``url()`` definitions are stripped
- Comments starting with an exclamation mark (``!``) can be kept optionally.
- All other comments and/or whitespace characters are replaced by a single
  space.
- Multiple consecutive semicolons are reduced to one
- The last semicolon within a ruleset is stripped
- CSS Hacks supported:

  - IE7 hack (``>/**/``)
  - Mac-IE5 hack (``/*\*/.../**/``)
  - The boxmodelhack is supported naturally because it relies on valid CSS2
    strings
  - Between ``:first-line`` and the following comma or curly brace a space is
    inserted. (apparently it's needed for IE6)
  - Same for ``:first-letter``

rcssmin.c is a reimplementation of rcssmin.py in C and improves runtime up to
factor 50 or so (depending on the input).

COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE
=====================

Copyright 2011, 2012
André Malo or his licensors, as applicable.

The whole package is distributed under the Apache License Version 2.0.
You'll find a copy in the root directory of the distribution or online at:
<http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

Both python 2 (>=2.4) and python 3 are supported.


INSTALLATION
============

rcssmin is set up using the standard python distutils. So you can install
it using the usual command:

$ python setup.py install

The command above will install rcssmin into python's library path.

Additionally it will install the documentation. On unices it will be
installed by default into <prefix>/share/doc/rcssmin.

For customization options please study the output of

$ python setup.py --help

Espescially the following options may be interesting for you:

  --without-c-extensions  Don't install C extensions
  --without-docs          Do not install documentation files

Alternatively just copy rcssmin.py into your project and use it.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

A generated API documentation is available in the docs/apidoc/ directory.
But you can just look into the module. It provides a simple function,
called cssmin which takes the script as a string and returns the minified
script as a string.

The module additionally provides a "streamy" interface:

$ python -mrcssmin <css >minified

It takes two options:

  -b  Keep bang-comments (Comments starting with an exclamation mark)
  -p  Use the python implementation (not the C implementation)

The latest documentation is also available online at
<http://opensource.perlig.de/rcssmin/>.


BUGS
====

No bugs, of course. ;-)
But if you've found one or have an idea how to improve rcssmin,
please send a mail to <rcssmin-bugs@perlig.de>.

INTRODUCTION
============

rJSmin is a javascript minifier written in python.

The minifier is based on the semantics of `jsmin.c by Douglas Crockford`_\.

The module is a re-implementation aiming for speed, so it can be used at
runtime (rather than during a preprocessing step). Usually it produces the
same results as the original ``jsmin.c``. It differs in the following ways:

- there is no error detection: unterminated string, regex and comment
  literals are treated as regular javascript code and minified as such.
- Control characters inside string and regex literals are left untouched; they
  are not converted to spaces (nor to \n)
- Newline characters are not allowed inside string and regex literals, except
  for line continuations in string literals (ECMA-5).
- "return /regex/" is recognized correctly.
- "+ ++" and "- --" sequences are not collapsed to '+++' or '---'
- rJSmin does not handle streams, but only complete strings. (However, the
  module provides a "streamy" interface).

Since most parts of the logic are handled by the regex engine it's way
faster than the original python port of ``jsmin.c`` by Baruch Even. The speed
factor varies between about 6 and 55 depending on input and python version
(it gets faster the more compressed the input already is). Compared to the
speed-refactored python port by Dave St.Germain the performance gain is less
dramatic but still between 1.2 and 7. See the docs/BENCHMARKS file for
details.

rjsmin.c is a reimplementation of rjsmin.py in C and speeds it up even more.
