Flask Sphinx Styles
===================

This repository contains sphinx styles for Flask and Flask related
projects.  To use this style in your Sphinx documentation, follow
this guide:

1. put this folder as _themes into your docs folder.  Alternatively
   you can also use git submodules to check out the contents there.
2. add this to your conf.py:

   sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('_themes'))
   html_theme_path = ['_themes']
   html_theme = 'flask'

The following themes exist:

- 'flask' - the standard flask documentation theme for large
  projects
- 'flask_small' - small one-page theme.  Intended to be used by
  very small addon libraries for flask.

The following options exist for the flask_small theme:

   [options]
   index_logo = ''              filename of a picture in _static
                                to be used as replacement for the
                                h1 in the index.rst file.
   index_logo_height = 120px    height of the index logo
   github_fork = ''             repository name on github for the
                                "fork me" badge

Grab is a python site scraping framework. Grab provides tons of helpful methods to scrape web sites
and to work with scraped content:

* Automatic cookies (session) support
* HTTP and SOCKS proxy with and without authorization
* Keep-Alive support
* IDN support
* Tools to work with web forms
* Easy multipart file uploading
* Flexible customization of HTTP requests
* Automatic charset detection
* Powerful API of extracting info from HTML documents with XPATH queries
* Asynchronous API to make thousands of simultaneous queries. This part of library called Spider and it is too big to even list its features in this README.
* Python 3 ready
* And much, much more
* Grab has written by the guy who is doing site scraping since 2005

Example of Grab usage::

    from grab import Grab

    g = Grab()
    g.go('https://github.com/login')
    g.set_input('login', 'lorien')
    g.set_input('password', '***')
    g.submit()
    for elem in g.doc.select('//ul[@id="repo_listing"]/li/a'):
        print '%s: %s' % (elem.text(), elem.attr('href'))


Example of Grab::Spider usage::

    from grab.spider import Spider, Task
    import logging

    class ExampleSpider(Spider):
        def task_generator(self):
            for lang in ('python', 'ruby', 'perl'):
                url = 'https://www.google.com/search?q=%s' % lang
                yield Task('search', url=url)
        
        def task_search(self, grab, task):
            print grab.doc.select('//div[@class="s"]//cite').text()


    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
    bot = ExampleSpider()
    bot.run()
