Chapter 3 - Clustering - Finding Related Posts
==============================================

For this chapter you will need the '20news' dataset from
http://mlcomp.org/datasets/379. To get the data you will need to
register, but it is totally free. When being logged in, you will 
see a ZIP download link.

Chapter 5 - Classification - Detecting Poor Answers
===================================================

The book chapter is based on StackExchange's data blob from August 2012:
[http://www.clearbits.net/get/2076-aug-2012.torrent](http://www.clearbits.net/get/2076-aug-2012.torrent)

After publishing the book, StackExchange stayed as awesome as it always has been and released an updated version:
[https://archive.org/download/stackexchange/stackexchange_archive.torrent](https://archive.org/download/stackexchange/stackexchange_archive.torrent)

Note that using the latest version, you will get slightly different results.

The code is using pyenchant for spell correction. Pyenchent is only used to increase your pleasure of eperimenting with additional features. It is not used later on the chapter. So, if you find out that your platform poses too big problems to install it (e.g. on 64bit Windows), don't bother.

Chapter 6 - Classification II - Sentiment Analysis
==================================================

When doing last code sanity checks for the book, Twitter
was using the API 1.0, which did not require authentication.
With its switch to version 1.1, this has now changed.

If you don't have already created your personal Twitter
access keys and tokens, you might want to do so at
[https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/tokens-devtwittercom](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/tokens-devtwittercom) and paste the keys/secrets into twitterauth.py

According to [https://dev.twitter.com/docs/rate-limiting/1](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/rate-limiting/1) Twitter has a rate limit of fetching 350 tweets/h for authorized users.

Note that some tweets might be missing when you are running install.py (user got suspended, changed authorization, or tweet deleted) and thus you might get different results. We keep track of those tweet IDs in data/{missing,not_authorized}.tsv, so that they are not fetched when you run install.py.
