OpenGIS(r) OWS Common- ReadMe.txt
===========================

OpenGIS(r) Web Service Common (OWS) Implementation Specification

More information on the OGC OWS Common standard may be found at
 http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/common

The most current schema are available at http://schemas.opengis.net/ .

The root (all-components) XML Schema Document, which includes
directly and indirectly all the XML Schema Documents, defined by
OWS 2.0 is owsAll.xsd .

* Latest version is: http://schemas.opengis.net/ows/2.0/owsAll.xsd *

	* v1.1.0: The 1.1.0 version of owsExceptionReport.xsd has been corrected 
	  to reflect the corrigenda (OGC 07-141).  The owsExceptionReport.xsd 
	  schema previously referenced an obsolete version of the XML schema.

2010-05-06  Jim Greenwood

	* v2.0.0: The 2.0.0 version are the XML Schema Documents for OGC
	  document 06-121r9, approved as an Implementation Specification in May
	  2005.

2010-01-21  Kevin Stegemoller 
	* update/verify copyright (06-135r7 s#3.2)
	* migrate relative to absolute URLs of schema imports (06-135r7 s#15)
	* updated xsd:schema:@version attribute (06-135r7 s#13.4)
	* add archives (.zip) files of previous versions
	* create/update ReadMe.txt (06-135r7 s#17)

2007-04-03  Arliss Whiteside

	* v1.1.0: OWS Common specification has been updated to version 1.1.0
	  (OGC 06-121r3). These very small changes are taken from corrigendum
	  (OGC 07-016) which corrects the schemaLocation references in
	  <import> declarations for the namespace
	  http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink, in the OWS Common 1.1 XML Schema.
	  These schemaLocation references are changed to relatively reference
	  the old schema location at
	  http://www.opengis.net/xlink/1.0.0/xlinks.xsd .  

	* Note: check each OGC numbered document for detailed changes.

2005-11-22  Arliss Whiteside

	* v1.0.0, v0.4.0, v0.3.2, v0.3.1, v0.3.0: All five of these sets of
	  XML Schema Documents have been edited to reflect the corrigenda to
	  all those OGC documents which are based on the change requests: 
	  OGC 05-068r1 "Store xlinks.xsd file at a fixed location"
	  OGC 05-081r2 "Change to use relative paths"

	* v1.0.0: The 1.0.0 version are the XML Schema Documents for OGC
	  document 05-008, approved as an Implementation Specification in May
	  2005.

	* v0.4.0: The 0.4.0 version are the XML Schema Documents for OGC
	  document 04-016r5.

	* v0.3.2: The 0.3.2 version are the XML Schema Documents after
	  correcting one small incorrect difference from OGC document
	  04-016r3.

	* v0.3.1: The 0.3.1 version are the XML Schema Documents attached to
	  OGC document 04-016r3, containing that editing of document 04-016r2.
	  This Recommendation Paper is available to the public at
	  http://portal.opengis.org/files/?artifact_id=6324.

	* v0.3.0: OWS Common set of XML Schema Documents from OGC document
	  04-016r2 approved as Recommendation Paper in the April 2004 OGC
