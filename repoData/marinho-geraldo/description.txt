Please move files from 'html' directory to 'site/docs'

To build documentation to HTML, you have to:

1. install Sphinx (sudo easy_install sphinx)
2. run 'make html'

Please look at the folder geraldo/tests to view the source code for these
examples.

Files will be temporarily stored here by tests. They shouldn't be added to Git or SVN repository.

Overview
========

Geraldo is a reports generator created to work like ReportBuilder, QuickReport
or Jasper Reports. It has bands with fixed width and flexible height to show on
top, summary, page header, page footer, in table or each one for an object.

It is under GPL and works only with Django framework and Python language.

It depends on ReportLab library to work.

This directory contains extra stuff that can improve your Django experience.

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development
and clean, pragmatic design.

All documentation is in the "docs" directory and online at
http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/.  If you're just getting started,
here's how we recommend you read the docs:

    * First, read docs/install.txt for instructions on installing Django.

    * Next, work through the tutorials in order (docs/tutorial01.txt,
      docs/tutorial02.txt, etc.).

    * If you want to set up an actual deployment server, read docs/modpython.txt
      for instructions on running Django under mod_python.

    * The rest of the documentation is of the reference-manual variety.
      Read it -- and the FAQ -- as you run into problems.

Docs are updated rigorously. If you find any problems in the docs, or think they
should be clarified in any way, please take 30 seconds to fill out a ticket
here:

http://code.djangoproject.com/newticket

To get more help:

    * Join the #django channel on irc.freenode.net. Lots of helpful people
      hang out there. Read the archives at http://simon.bofh.ms/logger/django/ .

    * Join the django-users mailing list, or read the archives, at
      http://groups.google.com/group/django-users.
