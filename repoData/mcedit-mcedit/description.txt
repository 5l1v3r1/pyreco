ALBOW - A Little Bit of Widgetry for PyGame
-------------------------------------------

Version 1.1

This is a rather basic, no-frills widget set for creating a GUI using
PyGame. It has been developed over the course of my last three
PyWeek competition entries.

Contents
--------

albow       Package containing the Python modules. Put it
            on your PYTHONPATH or in the top level directory
            of your PyGame application.
            
demo.py     A demonstration of most of Albow's functionality.
            Run it using
            
                 pythonw albow.py

doc         Documentation in html format. Start with index.html.

Resources   Some resources used by demo.py. Also contains some
            default fonts (Vera.ttf and VeraBd.ttf) that you can
            use in your applications if you wish.

# Reporting Issues

**Before** submitting an issue, read [Reporting Issues](https://github.com/mcedit/mcedit/wiki/Reporting-Issues) and be sure to include all of the required info in your description:

* **Steps to Reproduce** - Step by step, tell us exactly which buttons to click on, text to enter, and keys to press that lead you to discover the problem.
* **MCEdit Version Number** - Found in the title bar of the main window.
* **Minecraft Version Number** - You should already know how to find this. Also include a list of the mods you are using.
* **Operating System Version** - At the very least, say whether you are on Windows, Mac, or Linux. To get a more exact version (e.g. "Windows Vista SP1 64-bit", "Mac OS X 10.6.4"):
 + Windows: click Start, then right-click Computer and choose "Properties". 
 + Mac OS X: Choose "About This Mac" from the Apple menu.  
 + Linux: See your distro's documentation to find out how to get the version number.
 + An animal is not a version number.<br><br>

* **Error log** - If MCEdit tells you it had an error, there will be vital information inside the console window and/or error log file. On Windows, this is the file `mcedit.log` inside the `MCEdit-<version>-<platform>` folder. Use [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) or [gist](https://gist.github.com/) for logs longer than a dozen lines. On Mac OS X, error info can be copied from the Console utility. (`mcedit.log` is also present on OS X, though it's buried deep inside the application bundle.) On Linux, the error log will be shown on the terminal you started MCEdit from.


The issue tracker is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bugs),
[features requests](#features) and [submitting pull
requests](#pull-requests), but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use the thread on the Minecraft forums or the official MCEdit forums (not yet available)). Asking for help is a personal support request.

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ when using MCEdit itself, or when loading a MCEdit-modified world into a vanilla Minecraft game. Modified versions of Minecraft are not officially supported.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported. The search box is right next to the "New Issue" button.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest development builds from http://www.mcedit.net/


A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What steps will reproduce the issue? What OS and Minecraft versions
experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? If you use mods, have you tried a vanilla Minecraft install to confirm the problem is not mod-related? All these
details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> Minecraft version(s):
> MCEdit version(s):
> Operating system(s):
> Mods installed:
>
> A summary of the issue. If suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).

  <br />MCEdit is a versatile map utility, designed for moving blocks from one level to another. With it, you can open a level of nearly any type and fly around in glorious 3D with multiple levels of detail!  Select millions of blocks and clone them anywhere else in the level.  Fill a boxy selection with the block of your choice, or replace one kind of block with another.  Export blocks to a &quot;schematic&quot; file for later use.  Import a schematic or an entire level into any world using the crane.  Move the player or his spawn point.  Create and and remove chunks from the world.  Fill blackened areas with light.  Find bugs!

Open and save the following formats, compressed or non:
(saving not guaranteed)

<br>
<br>
Alpha Creative/Survival/Multiplayer (level.dat + folders)
<br>

Classic Indev (*.mclevel)

Classic Creative/Survival  (*.mine, server_level.dat)  **

<br>


** If your Classic level fails to load, or loads with the blocks all
out of order, put the dimensions of the map into the filename, e.g.
server_level_256_256_128.dat.
<br>
<br>


Import schematics created by MCEdit, schematics created by Redstone Simulator, and 
inventory files created by INVEdit. (as chests!)

<pre>

Caveats:

After increasing the window size, mouse input no longer works correctly.  
Restart MCEdit to fix this.
 
Support for non-English computers and foreign character sets is shaky. For best results, 
put the MCEdit folder directly into your C:\

Creating and deleting chunks will save them to disk or delete them immediately.

Cannot resize finite levels.

Many tiles are replaced when converting from the older maps to
Minecraft Alpha maps.  All cloth tiles are bleached white and any
"Infinite" liquids are replaced with still liquids.

The conversion also works the other way:  Blocks introduced since Alpha are
converted to white cloth when moved to a Classic level. There is no way to control
which blocks are replaced during a conversion.

There is no conversion between the old Indev and the older Creative/Survival.
Take caution when copying between them. 

Classic levels require their dimensions to be in the file name, or 
else MCEdit will attempt to guess them based on the file's size.

Having too many filters in the filters folder causes the list to go invisible. Remove some filters from the list to make the list in MCedit show up.

# MCEdit

MCEdit is an open-source, BSD-licenced world editor for the viral indie hit [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net/). For downloads and update info, visit the official website at [www.mcedit.net](http://www.mcedit.net/). The rest of this file is intended for computer programmers and Linux users.

## Running from source

MCEdit is written in Python using a variety of open source modules. When developing it is recommended to use virtualenv to keep dependencies sane and for easy deployment. You'll need Python 2.7 and `easy_install`/`pip` at a minimum before getting started. This quick guide assumes a unix-y OS.

Clone MCEdit:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mcedit/mcedit
```
Or, if you've already cloned MCEdit in the past and need to update, go to the existing source folder:
```bash
git pull --recurse-submodules
```

Optionally (but highly recommended), setup and activate [virtualenv](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv). virtualenv will simplify development by creating an isolated and barebones Python environment. Anything you install while virtualenv is active won't affect your system-wide Python installation, for example.

```bash
cd mcedit
easy_install virtualenv
virtualenv ENV
. ENV/bin/activate
```

Install various dependencies. This may take a bit (especially numpy). If installing pygame errors, try installing from a [binary packages](http://pygame.org/install.html) or following one of the guides from that page to install from source. On Windows, `easy_install` is preferred because it installs prebuilt binary packages. On Linux and Mac OS X, you may want to use `pip install` instead.

```bash
easy_install PyOpenGL
easy_install numpy
easy_install pygame
easy_install pyyaml
```

Ubuntu Linux users can install the following packages via apt-get to grab all the dependencies easily and install them into the system python. This also downloads all libraries required to build these modules using `pip install`

```bash
apt-get install python-opengl python-pygame python-yaml python-numpy
```

You should now be able to run MCEdit with `python mcedit.py` assuming you've installed all the dependencies correctly.
