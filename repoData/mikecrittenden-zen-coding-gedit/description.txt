====================

expand expressions - similar to CSS selectors - into HTML code.

Features
--------

Zen Coding is a swiss army knife for common CSS and XHTML tasks. [Read this](http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/wiki/Actions) 
for details. Note that almost every action highly depends on current caret
position inside text editor.

With this plugin, you can:

- Expand abbreviation with `Ctrl+E`
- Expand abbreviation as you type with `Ctrl+Alt+E`
- Wrap with abbreviation with `Ctrl+Shift+E`
- Balance tag inward or outward with `Ctrl+Alt+I` or `Ctrl+Alt+O`
- Merge lines with `Ctrl+Alt+M`
- Go to previous or next edit point with `Alt+Left` and `Alt+Right`
- Remove tag with `Ctrl+Alt+R`
- Split or join tags with `Ctrl+Alt+J`
- Toggle comment with `Ctrl+Alt+C`

Shortcuts can be changed in `zencoding/plugin.py` to fit your needs.
