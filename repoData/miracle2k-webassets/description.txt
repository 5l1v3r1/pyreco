Example using Google App Engine

This is not using any framework wrapper (e.g. django-assets, flask-assets),
but just shows the bare minimum approach.

To run the sample, use:

    $ ./appengine-sdk/dev_appserver.py examples/appengine

Remember, you need to build your assets manually:

    $ examples/appengine/assets.py

Standalone example
==================

This shows how you might use ``webassets`` outside of a Python project.

A global script ``webassets`` is installed by the Pyton package. In this
directory, run::

     $ webasssets -c bundles.yaml build

.. note::
    You need to have the ``clevercss`` PyPI package installed.

Then open ``index.html`` in your browser. The page will use the compressed
stylesheet that you have just built.

Asset management application for Python web development - use it to
merge and compress your JavaScript and CSS files.

        http://webassets.readthedocs.org/

        Since releases aren't exactly happening on a regular schedule, you are
        encouraged to use the latest code. ``webassets`` is pretty well tested,
        so as long as the build status icon above remains a reassuring green,
        you shouldn't run into any trouble.

        You can `download a tarball`__ of the development version, or
        install it via ``pip install webassets==dev``.
