    ~ What is Flask?

      Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug
      and Jinja2.  It's intended for getting started very quickly
      and was developed with best intentions in mind.

    ~ Is it ready?

      It's still not 1.0 but it's shaping up nicely and is
      already widely used.  Consider the API to slightly
      improve over time but we don't plan on breaking it.

    ~ What do I need?

      Jinja 2.4 and Werkzeug 0.7 or later.
      `pip` or `easy_install` will install them for you if you do
      `pip install Flask`.  I encourage you to use a virtualenv.
      Check the docs for complete installation and usage
      instructions.

    ~ Where are the docs?

      Go to http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/ for a prebuilt version
      of the current documentation.  Otherwise build them yourself
      from the sphinx sources in the docs folder.

    ~ Where are the tests?

      Good that you're asking.  The tests are in the
      flask/testsuite package.  To run the tests use the
      `run-tests.py` file:

        $ python run-tests.py

      If it's not enough output for you, you can use the
      `--verbose` flag:

        $ python run-tests.py --verbose

      If you just want one particular testcase to run you can
      provide it on the command line:

        $ python run-tests.py test_to_run

    ~ Where can I get help?

      Either use the #pocoo IRC channel on irc.freenode.net or
      ask on the mailinglist: http://flask.pocoo.org/mailinglist/

      See http://flask.pocoo.org/community/ for more resources.
