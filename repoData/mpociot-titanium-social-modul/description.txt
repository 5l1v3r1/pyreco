If you create a file named de.marcelpociot.social.js in this directory, it will be 
compiled and used as your module.  This allows you to run pure Javascript
modules that are pre-compiled.

You can place platform-specific files here in sub-folders named "android" and/or "iphone", just as you can with normal Titanium Mobile SDK projects.  Any folders and files you place here will be merged with the platform-specific files in a Titanium Mobile project that uses this module.

When a Titanium Mobile project that uses this module is built, the files from this platform/ folder will be treated the same as files (if any) from the Titanium Mobile project's platform/ folder.
