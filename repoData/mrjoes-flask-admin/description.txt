Flask Sphinx Styles
===================

This repository contains sphinx styles for Flask and Flask related
projects.  To use this style in your Sphinx documentation, follow
this guide:

1. put this folder as _themes into your docs folder.  Alternatively
   you can also use git submodules to check out the contents there.
2. add this to your conf.py:

   sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('_themes'))
   html_theme_path = ['_themes']
   html_theme = 'flask'

The following themes exist:

- 'flask' - the standard flask documentation theme for large
  projects
- 'flask_small' - small one-page theme.  Intended to be used by
  very small addon libraries for flask.

The following options exist for the flask_small theme:

   [options]
   index_logo = ''              filename of a picture in _static
                                to be used as replacement for the
                                h1 in the index.rst file.
   index_logo_height = 120px    height of the index logo
   github_fork = ''             repository name on github for the
                                "fork me" badge

Introduction
------------

Flask-Admin is a batteries-included, simple-to-use `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ extension that lets you
add admin interfaces to Flask applications. It is inspired by the *django-admin* package, but implemented in such
a way that the developer has total control of the look, feel and functionality of the resulting application.

Out-of-the-box, Flask-Admin plays nicely with various ORM's, including

- `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_,

- `MongoEngine <http://mongoengine.org/>`_,

- `pymongo <http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/>`_ and

- `Peewee <https://github.com/coleifer/peewee>`_.

It also boasts a simple file management interface and a `redis client <http://redis.io/>`_ console.

The biggest feature of Flask-Admin is flexibility. It aims to provide a set of simple tools that can be used for
building admin interfaces of any complexity. So, to start off with you can create a very simple application in no time,
with auto-generated CRUD-views for each of your models. But then you can go further and customize those views & forms
as the need arises.

Flask-Admin is an active project, well-tested and production ready.

Examples
--------
Several usage examples are included in the */examples* folder. Please feel free to add your own examples, or improve
on some of the existing ones, and then submit them via GitHub as a *pull-request*.
