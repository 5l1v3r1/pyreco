It is a small project, so there is no need to be formal.

# Testing

You don't have to include tests with contributions, or even run the tests on your changes, but doing so will of course make things faster and easier.

To run the tests, you have a couple of options.

Option 1: [tox][1]. Install tox, locate yourself in the main project
directory, and run `tox`. All dependencies will be installed in
virtual environments, and the code will be tested against Python 2.6
and 2.7, if they are installed on your system.

Option 2: Install [nose][2] and [mock][4]. Locate yourself in the main
project directory, and run `nosetests`.

# Building documentation

The documentation is hosted at readthedocs, and will be built automatically
when merged into the main branch.

If you make changes to the documentation and would like to preview them
locally, you will need to build the documentation.
Install [sphinx][3], locate yourself in the `docs` directory and
run `make html`. Then open the `_build/index.html` page.

Export [Day One][0] journal entries into html, text, or another format
using a Jinja template.

# Installation

Use [pip][4]:

    pip install dayone_export

You can also use easy install
(`easy_install dayone_export`)
or download the source and install
(`python setup.py install`).


Depending on how your Python installation is configured, you may
need extra permissions to install packages. If so, prefix the
installation command by `sudo` and a space.

Any of these methods will also install the dependencies
[Jinja2][1], [pytz][2], [python-dateutil][6], and  [Markdown][3].

# Quick start

Export your entire journal with

    dayone_export --output journal.html /path/to/Journal.dayone

To see available options, run

    dayone_export --help

# Custom templates and advanced options

You can specify a custom template using the command line option `--template`.

You can permanently override the default template by creating a new template named `default.html` and saving it in the folder `~/.dayone_export`.

Full documentation and information about creating new templates is available at [Read the Docs][5].
