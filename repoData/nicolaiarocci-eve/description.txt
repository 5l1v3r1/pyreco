Flask Sphinx Styles
===================

This repository contains sphinx styles for Flask and Flask related
projects.  To use this style in your Sphinx documentation, follow
this guide:

1. put this folder as _themes into your docs folder.  Alternatively
   you can also use git submodules to check out the contents there.
2. add this to your conf.py:

   sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('_themes'))
   html_theme_path = ['_themes']
   html_theme = 'flask'

The following themes exist:

- 'flask' - the standard flask documentation theme for large
  projects
- 'flask_small' - small one-page theme.  Intended to be used by
  very small addon libraries for flask.

The following options exist for the flask_small theme:

   [options]
   index_logo = ''              filename of a picture in _static
                                to be used as replacement for the
                                h1 in the index.rst file.
   index_logo_height = 120px    height of the index logo
   github_fork = ''             repository name on github for the
                                "fork me" badge

Eve is an out-of-the-box, highly customizable and fully featured RESTful Web
API framework that you can use to effortlessly build and deploy your own APIs

Eve is Simple
-------------
.. code-block:: python

    from eve import Eve

    app = Eve()
    app.run()

The API is now live, ready to be consumed:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -i http://example.com/people
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

All you need to bring your API online is a database, a configuration file
(defaults to ``settings.py``) and a launch script.  Overall, you will find that
configuring and fine-tuning your API is a very simple process.

Eve is thoroughly tested under Python 2.6, Python 2.7 and Python 3.3.
