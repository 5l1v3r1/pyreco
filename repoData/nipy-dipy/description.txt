Examples
--------

These are the dipy examples.  They are built as docs in the dipy
``examples_built`` directory in the documentation.

If you add an example (yes please!), please remember to add it also to the
``examples_index.rst`` file listing in the ``doc`` directory.

Examples built README
---------------------

This directory is a build-time container for the examples.  The
<root>/tools/make_examples.py script takes the examples in <root>/doc/examples,
compiles the examples to rst files, builds all the graphics, and puts the
result into this directory, along with copies of the .py files.

The contents of this directory then gets included because the
<root>/doc/example_index.rst file points to this directory and the built .rst
files.

Please don't put anything in this directory other than the .gitignore (ignore
everything) and this README.  If you need something in here, please copy it
from the make_examples.py script.
