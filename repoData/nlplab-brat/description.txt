# How to Contribute #

Patches, feature requests and other contributions are essential to keep brat
up-to-date and useful to the community at large. The brat maintainers deeply
appreciate your contributions and we want to try to make it easy for you to
contribute to the project. This document acts as a guideline for new
contributors.

## Getting Started ##

* If you don't have one, get a [GitHub Account][github_reg]
* If you have a feature request:
    * Search to check if an existing request exists on the
        [issue tracker][brat_issues], if not, file a new issue, otherwise add
        to the existing one
    * Try to motivate why you think the feature is valuable to your personal
        or group use and also to the community at large
    * Try to clearly describe the feature to an extent that it will be
        possible to implement it solely from your description
    * If possible, provide suggestions on how to implement the feature and
        mention if/how you think you can contribute towards it
* If you have found a bug:
    * Search to check if an existing report of the bug exists on the
        [issue tracker][brat_issues], if not, file a new issue, otherwise add
        to the existing one
    * Describe the bug clearly, include steps necessary to reproduce the bug
    * Mention which version or revision you observed the bug in
    * Try to mention relevant aspects of the system used to run brat,
        web server, web browser, operating system, Python version, etc.
    * If your issue is graphical in nature, please link to a screenshot of it
* If you want to hack on brat:
    * Fork the [repository][brat_repo]
    * See "Making Changes" and "Submitting Changes"

## Making Changes ##

* Create a topic branch for your fork to which you commit your work
    * Please avoid commiting changes to your master branch as it risks mixing
        code for unrelated fixes which makes merging the changes back to the
        main brat repository more difficult
* Make commits for small logical units of code and resources
* Test code is always encouraged

## Submitting Changes ##

* When submitting changes you agree that you and your potential employeer
    agrees to make the contribution available under the same licensing
    restrictions as brat itself
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork
* Submit a pull request to the main brat repository
* Wait for the brat maintainers to respond to your pull request

## Documentation ##

In an attempt to keep all user-facing documentation in one place, please visit
the [brat homepage][brat] which contains extensive documentation and examples
of how to use and configure brat. We apologise for only providing minimal
documentation along with the installation package but the risk of having
out-dated documentation delivered to our end-users is unacceptable.

If you find bugs in your brat installation or errors in the documentation,
please file an issue at our [issue tracker][brat_issues] and we will strive to
address it promptly.

## About brat ##

*brat* (brat rapid annotation tool) is based on the [stav][stav] visualiser
which was originally made in order to visualise
[BioNLP'11 Shared Task][bionlp_2011_st] data. brat aims to provide an
intuitive and fast way to create text-bound and relational annotations.
Recently, brat has been widely adopted in the community. It has been used to
create well-over 50,000 annotations by the [Genia group][genia] and several
other international research groups for a number of annotation projects.

[stav]:             https://github.com/nlplab/stav/
[bionlp_2011_st]:   http://2011.bionlp-st.org/
[genia]:            http://www.geniaproject.org/

brat aims to overcome short-comings of previous annotation tools such as:

* De-centralisation of configurations and data, causing synchronisation issues
* Annotations and related text not being visually adjacent
* Complexity of set-up for annotators
* Etc.

brat does this by:

* Data and configurations on a central web server (as Mark Twain said:
    "Put all your eggs in one basket, and then guard that basket!")
* Present text as it would appear to a reader and maintain annotations close
    to the text
* Zero set-up for annotators, leave configurations and server/data maintainence
    to other staff

## License ##

brat itself is available under the permissive [MIT License][mit] but
incorporates software using a variety of open-source licenses, for details
please see see LICENSE.md.

[mit]:  http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT

## Contributing ##

As with any software brat is under continuous development. If you have
requests for features please [file an issue][brat_issues] describing your
request. Also, if you want to see work towards a specific feature feel free to
contribute by working towards it. The standard procedure is to fork the
repository, add a feature, fix a bug, then file a pull request that your

# brat servlet #

This is a full-fledged brat CGI servlet to deploy brat on Tomcat. While this
is a bit of an exotic usecase, it is an existing one and this README along
with XML provided should keep you from crying your eyes out while solving this
exercise.

# Building #

First, some words on how this works. You will attempt a WAR (Web application
ARchive) containing a working brat installation. This means you will first
have to install brat as usual and deploy your data. Deploy your brat
installation in `brat/WEB-INF/cgi`, then, proving that you don't need ant to
build something Java-ish, simply run:

    make

This will produce a file `brat.war` that you can deploy on Tomcat.

# Installation #

Drop the `brat.war` into the Tomcat `webapps` directory and you should be able
to access your installation using:

    http://${HOSTNAME}:${PORT}/brat/

From now on, brat should work as usual with the exception that it is Tomcat
serving your requests.
