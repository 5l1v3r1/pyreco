Testing
-------

The CI test suite previously running at [Shining Panda](http://shiningpanda.com)
is down due to them having taken their Clap de Fin. There have been some
investigations into moving to other CI, but no official build is running right
now. This may change in the near future.

nltk/test/runtests.py is a good starting point for running tests locally, but
note that the suite is currently failing.

NLTK -- the Natural Language Toolkit -- is a suite of open source
Python modules, data sets and tutorials supporting research and
development in Natural Language Processing.

Documentation: A substantial amount of documentation about how
to use NLTK, including a textbook and API documention, is
available from the NLTK website: http://nltk.org/

  - The book covers a wide range of introductory topics in NLP, and
    shows how to do all the processing tasks using the toolkit.

  - The toolkit's reference documentation describes every module,
    interface, class, method, function, and variable in the toolkit.
    This documentation should be useful to both users and developers.  

Mailing Lists: There are several mailing lists associated with NLTK:

  - nltk: Public information and announcements about NLTK (very low volume)
      http://groups.google.com/group/nltk
  - nltk-users: Discussions amongst NLTK users
      http://groups.google.com/group/nltk-users
  - nltk-dev: Discussions amongst NLTK developers
      http://groups.google.com/group/nltk-dev
  - nltk-translation: Discussions about translating the NLTK book
