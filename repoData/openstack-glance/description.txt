openstack-common
----------------

A number of modules from openstack-common are imported into this project.

These modules are "incubating" in openstack-common and are kept in sync
with the help of openstack-common's update.py script. See:

  https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Oslo#Syncing_Code_from_Incubator

The copy of the code should never be directly modified here. Please
always update openstack-common first and then run the script to copy
the changes across.

This directory contains rally benchmark scenarios to be run by OpenStack CI.
