#OpenWorm database files#

To load the SQL files, check out [this reference](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/import-mysql-dumpfile-sql-datafile-into-my-database/).

* CElegansNeuronMetabolites.sql -- a database containing metabolites present in the c. elegans created by Tim Busbice
* JSH.sql -- a database containing a subset of synapse positions from the Emmons lab compiled by Steve Cook
* OpenWormDatabase-06-12-13.sql -- a composite database from many spreadsheets containing neurons, proteins, and more created by Crystin Slade

We are currently in the process of consolidating many spreadsheets into databases.  Our collection of spreadsheets [can be found](https://drive.google.com/?tab=wo&authuser=0#folders/0B_t3mQaA-HaMejlrMmpnR2VjN0U) in the public Google Drive repository.

========

This repository stores:
* project-wide [Kanban board of all issues](https://waffle.io/openworm/openworm)
* project-wide tracking via high-level [issues](https://github.com/openworm/OpenWorm/issues?labels=&milestone=&page=1&state=open) and [milestones](https://github.com/openworm/OpenWorm/issues/milestones)

This repository DOES NOT store:
* Code for simulating the body of the worm.  That's [Sibernetic in the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics repo](https://github.com/openworm/Smoothed-Particle-Hydrodynamics)
* Code for integrating the model and putting it on the web.  That's [Geppetto](https://github.com/openworm/org.geppetto)
* Code for the neural network for the worm.  That's [CElegansNeuroML](https://github.com/openworm/CElegansNeuroML)
* Code for validating the worm against real worm data.  That's [movement_validation](https://github.com/openworm/movement_validation)

and a bunch more.  People often fork this repo but be aware that it is mainly a project tracking meta-repo more than the place where all the code and data are.  Please see [the documentation](http://docs.openworm.org/en/0.5/intro.html) for more direction on the different [projects](http://docs.openworm.org/en/0.5/projects.html) and [repos](http://docs.openworm.org/en/0.5/Community/repositories.html#repositories) that we have.

About **OpenWorm**:

[OpenWorm](http://openworm.org) aims to build the first comprehensive computational model of the *Caenorhabditis elegans* (*C. elegans*), a microscopic roundworm. With only a thousand cells, it solves basic problems such as feeding, mate-finding and predator avoidance. Despite being extremely well-studied in biology, a deep, principled understanding of the biology of this organism remains elusive.

We are using a bottom-up approach, aimed at observing the worm behaviour emerge from a simulation of data derived from scientific experiments carried out over the past decade. To do so we are incorporating the data available from the scientific community into software models. We are also forging new collaborations with universities and research institutes to collect data that fill in the gaps.
