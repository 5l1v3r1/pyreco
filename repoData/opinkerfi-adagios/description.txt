### Contributing to Chosen

Contributions and pull requests are very welcome. Please follow these guidelines when submitting new code.

1. Make all changes in Coffeescript files, **not** JavaScript files.
2. For feature changes, update both jQuery *and* Prototype versions
3. Use `npm install -d` to install the correct development dependencies.
4. Use `cake build` or `cake watch` to generate Chosen's JavaScript file and minified version.
5. Don't touch the `VERSION` file
6. Submit a Pull Request using GitHub.

### Using CoffeeScript & Cake

First, make sure you have the proper CoffeeScript / Cake set-up in place. We have added a package.json that makes this easy:

```
npm install -d
```

This will install `coffee-script` and `uglifyjs`.

Once you're configured, building the JavasScript from the command line is easy:

    cake build                # build Chosen from source
    cake watch                # watch coffee/ for changes and build Chosen
    
If you're interested, you can find the recipes in Cakefile.

Select2
=================

Select2 is a jQuery based replacement for select boxes. It supports searching, remote data sets, and infinite scrolling of results. Look and feel of Select2 is based on the excellent [Chosen](http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/) library.

To get started -- checkout http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2!

What Does Select2 Support That Chosen Does Not?
-------------------------------------------------

* Working with large datasets: Chosen requires the entire dataset to be loaded as `option` tags in the DOM, which limits
it to working with small-ish datasets. Select2 uses a function to find results on-the-fly, which allows it to partially
load results.
* Paging of results: Since Select2 works with large datasets and only loads a small amount of matching results at a time
it has to support paging. Select2 will call the search function when the user scrolls to the bottom of currently loaded
result set allowing for the 'infinite scrolling' of results.
* Custom markup for results: Chosen only supports rendering text results because that is the only markup supported by
`option` tags. Select2 provides an extension point which can be used to produce any kind of markup to represent results.
* Ability to add results on the fly: Select2 provides the ability to add results from the search term entered by the user, which allows it to be used for
tagging.

Browser Compatibility
--------------------
* IE 8+ (7 mostly works except for [issue with z-index](https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2/issues/37))
* Chrome 8+
* Firefox 3.5+
* Safari 3+
* Opera 10.6+

Integrations
------------

* [Wicket-Select2](https://github.com/ivaynberg/wicket-select2) (Java / Apache Wicket)
* [select2-rails](https://github.com/argerim/select2-rails) (Ruby on Rails)
* [AngularUI](http://angular-ui.github.com/#directives-select2) ([AngularJS](angularjs.org))
* [Django](https://github.com/applegrew/django-select2)
