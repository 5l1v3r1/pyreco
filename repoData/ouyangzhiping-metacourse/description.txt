metaTED is a tool that makes it easy to download all of the `TED talks`_. It
does so by creating over 1,000 `metalinks`_ of TED talks varying in both the
quality levels and possible talk groupings by directory. Features include:

    * Creates talks with informative file names - i.e.
      ``Unconventional Explanations/Hans Rosling on HIV - New facts and stunning data visuals.mp4``
      instead of original ``HansRosling_2009_480.mp4``.

    * Provides subtitles for talks in over 85 supported languages. New
      languages and translations are added daily through the
      `TED Open Translation Project`_, and you help out by
      `becoming a translator today`_.

    * Tries hard to get all of the talks, or at least most of them - with a good
      reason if some have failed.

    * More choice - creates one metalink per available quality level
      (currently low, standard and high).

    * More choice - creates one metalink per available talk grouping, with all
      talks belonging to the same group placed inside a common directory. The
      possible talk groupings are extracted from talks metadata (currently
      filming year, publishing year, event name and author).

    * Aggressive caching throughout the project, to avoid expensive network/CPU
      operations as much as possible. Proper cache invalidation included.

    * High levels of fault tolerance. 

    * Simple, yet powerful homegrown web crawler. 

    * Flexible and extensible software design with changes in mind.

    * Provides both the console script and a public API.

Downloading TED talks
=====================

If you just want to `download TED talks`_, you don't need to install this
package, or even Python. All you need to do is get a
`download client that supports the Metalink standard`_ and choose one of the
`daily updated metalinks`_.

Installing and running metaTED
==============================

You can install metaTED with `pip`_ via ``pip install metaTED``. You can run it
with ``metaTED``, or ``metaTED -h`` to get help and the list of all available
options.

The project itself is `hosted on bitbucket`_, from where you can get the code
and report bugs.

New in metaTED 2.1.0
====================

Feature additions
-----------------

    * Fixed #13, #14: Switched to hard subtitled video download URLs, as there
      have been issues with externally hosted soft subtitles. The 'standard'
      quality level has unfortunately been removed, as TED doesn't provide hard
      subtitles for it.

    * Removed `theme` from `talk_info` metadata as TED stopped providing theme
      information in their HTML.

Bugfixes
--------

    * Updated author marker as TED updated their HTML layout.

    * Fixed #15: Updated code for finding talk urls as TED added pagination to
      their talk list page. Reintroduced `talks_urls` caching to improve
      performance.

* courera
* railscast
* TED

未来将补充完善其它优质课程的网站。当然，你也有更简单的应用办法，就是使用我已经解析之后的下载列表文件。放在`download`目录中。

## 用法

将本项目git clone到本地。

	git clone https://github.com/ouyangzhiping/metacourse.git
	cd metacourse

## courera课程

### 安装courera

### 准备python环境
