Following the latest days internet outrage/overreaction to the
revelation that [iPhone has a cache] for its location service, I decided
to have look what my Android devices caches for the same function.

This is a quick dumper I threw together to parse the files from the
Android location provider.

The files are named `cache.cell` & `cache.wifi` and is located in
`/data/data/com.google.android.location/files` on the Android device.

You will need root access to the device to read this directory.

How to disable:
Find `Settings -> Location & Security -> Use wireless networks` and uncheck it.

This removes the files on 2.3 devices, my 2.2 device keeps the files but stops updating them.
Other versions are unknown at this moment.


Usage:

```console
$ parse.py <cache file>
```

You can also pass the `--gpx` option to get ouptut in [GPX
format], then use [gpsbabel] or something to get the data into the
format of your choice:

```console
$ parse.py --gpx cache.wifi > wifi.gpx
```

Important note: looking at old android source (this code is no longer
open from Google it seems) it seems to be limited heavily.

However, data is only pruned when new info is added. There is no time
based pruning unless there is new data being added to the cache. This
could lead to old data being if there is limited movement of the
device.

```java
    // Maximum time (in millis) that a record is valid for, before it needs
    // to be refreshed from the server.
    private static final long MAX_CELL_REFRESH_RECORD_AGE = 12 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 12 hours
    private static final long MAX_WIFI_REFRESH_RECORD_AGE = 48 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 48 hours

    // Cache sizes
    private static final int MAX_CELL_RECORDS = 50;
    private static final int MAX_WIFI_RECORDS = 200;
```


Example output:

```console
$ ./parse.py cache.wifi
