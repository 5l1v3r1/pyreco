Use The Force, Grapher
======================

## Plugins

These are the default plugins that we ship with Mailpile.

Developers: Check out the `demos` plugin and see our github wiki for
details on how to write your own.

Note that user-installed plugins go in `$HOME/.mailpile/plugins`.


SMS
===

A plugin to allow people to send SMS messages from their Mailpiles using 3rd party services (Twilio, Tropo, etc...)

Interested in helping develop this? See this [Github Issue](https://github.com/pagekite/Mailpile/issues/268)

#### Dependencies

For US based numbers, Twilio is an excellent service that handles sending & receiving of SMS messages via a REST API. 

twilio_sms.py is a simple test that sends messages once you hav the twilio dependency installed via pip or other methods

[Twilio Python SDK](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-python)

`$ pip install twilio`

*Twilio is free to test out once you create an account, but costs $0.01 per SMS message you send/receive*

## Introduction ##

Mailpile (<https://www.mailpile.is/>) is a modern, fast web-mail client with
user-friendly encryption and privacy features. The development of Mailpile
is funded by [a large community of backers](https://www.mailpile.is/#community)
and all code related to the project is and will be released under an OSI
approved Free Software license.

Mailpile places great emphasis on providing a clean, elegant user interface
and pleasant user experience. In particular, Mailpile aims to make it easy
and convenient to receive and send PGP encrypted or signed e-mail.

Mailpile's primary user interface is web-based, but it also has a basic
command-line interface and an API for developers. Using web technology for
the interface allows Mailpile to function both as a local desktop
application (accessed by visiting `localhost` in the browser) or a remote
web-mail on a personal server or VPS.

The core of Mailpile is a fast search engine, custom written to deal
with large volumes of e-mail on consumer hardware. The search engine
allows e-mail to be organized using tags (similar to GMail's labels) and
the application can be configured to automatically tag incoming mail
either based on static rules or bayesian classifiers.

**Note:** We are currently at an early alpha state of development, so if you
just want a useful tool and aren't interested in hacking on the code, you
should probably check back later or [follow @MailpileTeam on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/MailpileTeam) and watch for updates.


### Trying Mailpile

We have live demos up and running [on our
website](https://www.mailpile.is/demos/). If you are curious about what
Mailpile looks like, please feel free to check it out.


### Installing Mailpile

Note that Mailpile is still in early development and is not suitable
for production or end-user use. However, developers are encouraged to
give it a try and even help us find bugs, fix them and develop new
features.

Please see [the wiki for
details](https://github.com/pagekite/Mailpile/wiki/Getting-started).

it's neat, you should also check out PageKite: <https://pagekite.net/>

The GMail guys get mad props for creating the best webmail service out
there.  Wishing the Free Software world had something like it is what
inspired me to start working on this.

Rebar
=====

Rebar helps make developing the front-end CSS of your application easy. Born out of frustration with existing offerings- frameworks like Bootstrap & Foundation are too heavy & opinated when it comes to design. Ever tried making a site with Bootstrap that doesn't look like a site made with Bootstrap? While possible, doing so requires you to dive in an learn the Bootstrap deeply. Meanwhile, bolierplates like HTML5 or GoldenGrid, are much too small of a building block to build a real web application I often found myself doing uneccesary repetitive scaffolding & mixing of libraries and helpers just to get going.

If you are like me and found neither extreme a good fit- Rebar might be right for you. Also, many of the aspects of Rebar are what is considered modern front-end development- webfonts, CSS preprocessors, SVG icons. As we have included these things we have also tried to explain them to those unfamiliar.

Think of Rebar as a toolbox + some blueprints to help you get building beautiful modern responsive web applications quickly. Additionally, Rebar aims to provide you with an dependency architecture that should meet most of your needs without getting in your way no mater the scale of your application.  :)


Features
------------

* CSS Reset
* HTML5 Element Styling
* Responsive Grid
* Responsive Boxes
* Icons
* Webfonts
* Color Palate
* LESS Templating
* LESS Mixins
* CSS3 Animations

### LESS

Before you can really do anything of real value with Rebar, you need to feel comfortable working with LESS. If you're totally unfamiliar go to http://lesscss.org and read up and find a basic tutorial somewhere. If you're scratching your head and saying WTF? You not be ready to use LESS or Rebar just yet. However, if you want to take your web dev skills to the next level you need to start using LESS or SASS and they will make your life *much* better, I promise.


#### Architecture

* **config.less**

This is where the magic happens. Inspired by the Customize & Theme Generator for Bootstrap, in  **config.less** you define fonts, colors, sizes of your app. By tweaking a few things your app can get quite a custom look and feel going quite easily.


* **css/**
	* app.css
	* guide.css

This is where the actual css files that you load in your web application reside. The **app.css** file is  output from the LESS preprocessor (don't edit this file). The guide file is custom CSS that only pertains to your style guide page- change this to suit your fancy.


* **less/app/** 
	* backgrounds.less
	* fonts.less
	* icons.less
	* messages.less
	* mobile.less
	* tablet.less
	* web.less

This folder contains your application's LESS templates. Add your own files, or modify the exisitng webfonts, icons, and device spefic layouts however you like.


* **less/app.less** 

This file is what creates the final **app.css** that you load in your application. This is where you choose which Rebar components and mixins you want to include. You can also include any number of custom .less files for your application


* **less/rebar/**
	* base.less
	* links.less
	* typography.less
	* navigation.less
	* lists.less
	* elements.less
	* images.less
	* buttons.less
	* forms.less
	* tables.less
	* responsive-grid.less
	* responsive-boxes.less

This folder contains the Rebar LESS templates. By default these files are all included in the **less/app.less** but, you may leave out which ever files your app does not. Example: if you do not use tables leave out **tables.less** to cut down on the final CSS file size.


* **less/mixins/** 
	* animate.less
	* elements.less
	* shapes.less

LESS Mixins are collection of really useful snippets and helpers made by 3rd parties which make doing things like animation, gradients, and shapes really easy. You may not want or need any of these things- in which case just delete these files from your app and delete


What's Missing
--------------------

Rebar would LIKE to be able to easily switch between fixed and fluid grid designs, we don't have this functionality, yet.

At the moment Rebar offers very little aethetics for your site unless you want it to look like the demo page. Thus, if you are not a desiger or are not working with a designer, you may want to use Bootstrap or something else.



Where's the JavaScript?
--------------------------------

If you need a lightbox, dropdown menu, tooltips, typeahead, or snazy Javascript things- you ain't gonna find that here. This is an intentional decision and we don't ever plan to add JS libraries to Rebar. We believe responsive design and the CSS to do so is complex enough to warrant it's own framework- we think libraries and frameworks should never try to do *everything*
