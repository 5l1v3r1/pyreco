This folder contains the code used to create the plots in the examples.  
The code is not very difficult, however I never meant for it to go out to readers. 
 It’s not the cleanest code nor very well documented.  Most of the time I threw 
together a dirty hack to make the plots look right, with no thoughts about 
efficiency or readability.   I’m providing it as-is, if you have a question on 
how it works or why I did something please ask, I will be more than happy to answer 
any questions.

The code for the examples in Ch.2 is contained in the python module: kNN.py.
The examples assume that datingTestSet.txt is in the current working directory.  
Folders testDigits, and trainingDigits are assumed to be in this folder also.

Machine Learning in Action 
==========================

This is the source code to go with "Machine Learning in Action" 
by Peter Harrington published by Manning Inc.
The official page for this book can be found here: http://manning.com/pharrington/

All the code examples were working on Python 2.6, there shouldn't be any problems with the 2.7.  NumPy will be needed for most examples.  If you have trouble running any of the examples us know on the Forum for this book: http://www.manning-sandbox.com/forum.jspa?forumID=728.  

If you want to run these on some other version of Python say--3.0 or IronPython, feel free to fork the code.
