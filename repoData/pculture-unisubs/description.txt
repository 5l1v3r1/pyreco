The files in this directory handles setting up and running an amara
development environment using docker.

SETUP:

We run a docker container for each of the services needed for amara (mysql,
rabbitmq, etc).  Then run a docker container to handle things like management
commands, testing, etc.

STARTING SERVICES

The first step to using the docker dev environment is always starting the
services.  The first time this runs, we will need to build all the images
which will take a while:

./startup.py

Notes:
  - You will either need to run these scripts as root, or add your user to the
    docker group.  (Read the Why Sudo? section in
    http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/use/basics/ for more info)

  - After restarting the host machine, you may need to restart the docker
    network with:

    sudo sh reset-docker-network.sh

  - If you or someone else changes a Dockerfile, use ./startup --rebuild to
    rebuild all images.

RUNNING A TEST SERVER:

In one terminal, start the celery worker:

./worker.py

In another terminar, start the webserver:

./runserver.py

RUNNING DJANGO MANAGEMENT

./manage.py command [args]

RUNNING TESTS:

./test.py [args]

STOPPING SERVICES:

./shutdown.py

NOTES ON SERVICES:

We set up several docker images/containers to provide services for the dev
envonment.  Here's some details about them:

* amara-dev-mysql
  port: 51000
  user: "root"
  password: ""

* amara-dev-solr
  port: 51001

* amara-dev-rabbitmq:
  port: 51002

* amara-dev-memcached:
  port: 51003

This repository is the code for the [Amara][] project.

The full documentation can be found at
http://amara.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html

[Amara]: http://universalsubtitles.org

Quick Start
-----------

Amara uses [Vagrant][] to make it easy to get started.  If you've
never used Vagrant before we highly recommend going through its [quick start
guide][vagrant-guide] to learn how it works.

[Vagrant]: http://vagrantup.com/
[vagrant-guide]: http://docs.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/index.html

To run the development version:

1. Git clone the repository:

        git clone git://github.com/pculture/unisubs.git unisubs

   Now the entire project will be in the unisubs directory.

2. Install VirtualBox and vagrant if you don't have them yet. Then type:

        vagrant up

   This is going to create a vm and provision it. It should take 10-15 minutes.
   Remember what mom said: a watched pot never boils.

3. Switch over to your vagrant vm with:

        vagrant ssh

   By default our `~/.bashrc` file will automatically move you to the shared
   folder and activate the virtualenv.

   Now run following command:

        bootstrap-vagrant.sh

   It's safe to run `bootstrap-vagrant.sh` multiple times if something goes
   wrong (like PyPi goes down).

4. Add `unisubs.example.com` to your hosts file, pointing at `127.0.0.1`.  This
   is necessary for Twitter and Facebook oauth to work correctly.

5. In your vagrant vm (the one you switched to in step 3), run the site with:

        dev-runserver.sh

   You can access the site at <http://unisubs.example.com:8000>.

Testing
-------

To run unit tests, use the `pmt` alias.  This will ensure that you're using the
correct settings for testing.

You can specify specific tests to run, just like if you were using `nosetests`.
For example:

    $ vagrant ssh

    # Just the tests in apps/teams/tests/permissions.py
    $ pmt apps.teams.tests.permissions

    # Tests defined as a class in apps/teams/tests/permissions.py
    $ pmt apps.teams.tests.permissions:TestRules

    # One specific test
    $ pmt apps.teams.tests.permissions:TestRules.test_can_add_video

    # Everything:
    $ pmt

Note: you may need to rebuild the Solr schema after running tests.  To do so,
run the following command on the server:

    sudo ./deploy/update_solr_schema_vagrant.sh

**TODO:** Fix this.

Optional
--------

You can optionally set up a few other pieces of the development environment that
we haven't automated yet.

### RabbitMQ and Celery

Add the following to `settings_local.py` to use RabbitMQ and Celery for async
tasks:

    CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER = False
    CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = "amqp"
    BROKER_BACKEND = 'amqplib'
    BROKER_HOST = "localhost"
    BROKER_PORT = 5672
    BROKER_USER = "usrmquser"
    BROKER_PASSWORD = "usrmqpassword"
    BROKER_VHOST = "ushost"

### Werkzeug Debugger

If you want to use the awesome Werkzeug debugging runserver instead of the
standard Django one, you just have to run (while the virtualenv is activated):

    pip install werkzeug

And then use `./dev-runserver.sh plus` to run it.

### bpython shell

If you want to use the awesome bpython shell instead of the normal one you just
need to run (while the virtualenv is activated):

    pip install bpython

Now when you run `pm shell` it will use bpython automatically.

### Metrics

If you want to collect metrics when developing locally (just out of curiosity,
or if you want to add some of your own and test them) you'll need to set up the
amara-metrics Vagrant box:

    git clone git://github.com/pculture/amara-metrics.git metrics
    cd metrics
    vagrant up

Then add the following line to `/etc/hosts` on your local (host) machine:

    10.10.10.44	graphite.example.com

Finally, turn on metric reporting by changing the `ENABLE_METRICS` setting in
`settings_local.py` to `True`.

Now load a few pages to generate some stats, then point your browser at
<http://graphite.example.com> to see the Graphite dashboard.  The stats should
be under `unisubs` (which is the hostname of the Vagrant VM).
