To developers:
Please use the most recent Sphinx version and just call the script to build the docs. Older versions of Sphinx have a bug while inserting example codes into the rst format. I've fixed in the patch sphinx06_code_patch.py and reported to Sphinx team which already have fixed it.

This is the new official Pyevolve repository.

The documentation (html rendered) is still hosted at sourceforge.net at http://pyevolve.sourceforge.net/0_6rc1/
