Python aubio module
===================

This module wraps the aubio library for Python using the numpy module.

Before compiling this module, you must have compiled libaubio.

For more information about how this module works, please refer to the [Python/C
API Reference Manual] (http://docs.python.org/c-api/index.html) and the
[Numpy/C API Reference](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/c-api.html).

Compiling python aubio
----------------------

After libaubio has been build successfully, and provided Python development
headers and numpy can be found on your system, you should be able to build the
aubio Python module:

    $ ./setup.py build

To find out more about `setup.py` options:

    $ ./setup.py --help

Installing
----------

To install the Python module:

    $ ./setup.py install

Using the Python module
-----------------------

Once the aubio library and the Python module are installed, you will be able to
import the aubio module:

    $ python
    [...]
    >>> import aubio
    >>>

Alternatively, you may want to use the Python module without installing it by
setting PYTHONPATH:

    $ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD/`ls -rtd build/lib.* | head -1`:$PWD/tests

Similarly, you can use the aubio module without installing libaubio by pointing
LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the path libaubio can be found at:

    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:PWD/../build/src

Or on Mac OS X systems, setting DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:

    $ export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PWD/../build/src

Testing the Python module
-------------------------

Once both the C library and the Python module have been built correctly, and
after you have installed them (or setting the environment variable correctly),
you should be able to run the tests:

    $ ./tests/run_all_tests

And to try out the demos:

    $ ./demos/demo_source.wav /path/to/sound/sample.wav

You need to install additional modules to run some of the demos. For
instance, several demos use [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) to draw plots.
Some more demos use [PySoundCard](https://github.com/bastibe/PySoundCard) to
play and record sounds.

# Here you will find some examples of python scripts and some evaluation
# routines. The python interface for libaubio is generated using Swig.

# To have it working before installation, you will need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
# for instance, to run the python script from within aubio/python/, you can use
# '. README'

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../src/.libs:../ext/.libs
export PYTHONPATH=aubio/.libs

aubio library
=============

aubio is a library to label music and sounds. It listens to audio signals and
attempts to detect events. For instance, when a drum is hit, at which frequency
is a note, or at what tempo is a rhythmic melody.

Its features include segmenting a sound file before each of its attacks,
performing pitch detection, tapping the beat and producing midi streams from
live audio.

aubio provide several algorithms and routines, including:

  - several onset detection methods
  - different pitch detection methods
  - tempo tracking and beat detection
  - MFCC (mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients)
  - FFT and phase vocoder
  - up/down-sampling
  - digital filters (low pass, high pass, and more)
  - spectral filtering
  - transient/steady-state separation
  - sound file and audio devices read and write access
  - various mathematics utilities for music applications

The name aubio comes from _audio_ with a typo: some errors are likely to be
found in the results.

Python module
-------------

A python module to access the library functions is also provided. Please see
the file `python/README` for more information on how to use it.

Examples tools
--------------

A few simple command line tools are included along with the library:

 - `aubioonset` outputs the time stamp of detected note onsets
 - `aubiopitch` attempts to identify a fundamental frequency, or pitch, for
   each frame of the input sound
 - `aubiomfcc` computes Mel-frequency Cepstrum Coefficients
 - `aubiotrack` outputs the time stamp of detected beats
 - `aubionotes` emits midi-like notes, with an onset, a pitch, and a duration
 - `aubioquiet` extracts quiet and loud regions

Additionaly, the python module comes with the following script:

 - `aubiocut` slices sound files at onset or beat timestamps

Implementation and Design Basics
--------------------------------

The library is written in C and is optimised for speed and portability.

The C API is designed in the following way:

    aubio_something_t * new_aubio_something (void * args);
    audio_something_do (aubio_something_t * t, void * args);
    smpl_t aubio_something_get_a_parameter (aubio_something_t *t);
    uint_t aubio_something_set_a_parameter (aubio_something_t *t, smpl_t a_parameter);
    void del_aubio_something (aubio_something_t * t);

For performance and real-time operation, no memory allocation or freeing take
place in the `_do` methods. Instead, memory allocation should always take place
in the `new_` methods, whereas free operations are done in the `del_` methods.

Installation and Build Instructions
-----------------------------------

A number of distributions already include aubio. Check your favorite package
management system, or have a look at the [download
page](http://aubio.org/download).

aubio uses [waf](https://code.google.com/p/waf/) to configure, compile, and
test the source:

    ./waf configure
    ./waf build
    sudo ./waf install

aubio compiles on Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin, and iPhone.

Credits and Publications
------------------------

This library gathers music signal processing algorithms designed at the Centre
for Digital Music and elsewhere. This software project was developed along the
research I did at the Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary, University of
London. Most of this C code was written by myself, starting from published
papers and existing code. The header files of each algorithm contains brief
descriptions and references to the corresponding papers.

Special thanks go Juan Pablo Bello, Chris Duxbury, Samer Abdallah, Alain de
Cheveigne for their help and publications. Also many thanks to Miguel Ramirez
and Nicolas Wack for their bug fixing.
