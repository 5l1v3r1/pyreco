# dataset ChangeLog

*The changelog has only been started with version 0.3.12, previous
changes must be reconstructed from revision history.*

* 0.5.1: Fix a regression where empty queries would raise an exception.
* 0.5: Improve overall code quality and testing, including Travis CI.
  An advanced __getitem__ syntax which allowed for the specification 
  of primary keys when getting a table was dropped. 
  DDL is no longer run against a transaction, but the base connection. 
* 0.4: Python 3 support and switch to alembic for migrations.
* 0.3.15: Fixes to update and insertion of data, thanks to @cli248
  and @abhinav-upadhyay.
* 0.3.14: dataset went viral somehow. Thanks to @gtsafas for
  refactorings, @alasdairnicol for fixing the Freezfile example in 
  the documentation. @diegoguimaraes fixed the behaviour of insert to
  return the newly-created primary key ID. table.find_one() now
  returns a dict, not an SQLAlchemy ResultProxy. Slugs are now generated
  using the Python-Slugify package, removing slug code from dataset. 
* 0.3.13: Fixed logging, added support for transformations on result
  rows to support slug generation in output (#28).
* 0.3.12: Makes table primary key's types and names configurable, fixing
  #19. Contributed by @dnatag.

krTheme Sphinx Style
====================

This repository contains sphinx styles Kenneth Reitz uses in most of
his projects. It is a derivative of Mitsuhiko's themes for Flask and Flask related
projects.  To use this style in your Sphinx documentation, follow
this guide:

1. put this folder as _themes into your docs folder. Alternatively
   you can also use git submodules to check out the contents there.

2. add this to your conf.py:

    sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('_themes'))
    html_theme_path = ['_themes']
    html_theme = 'kr'

The following themes exist:

**kr**
    the standard flask documentation theme for large projects

**kr_small**
    small one-page theme.  Intended to be used by very small addon libraries.


dataset: databases for lazy people
==================================

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/pudo/dataset.png)](https://travis-ci.org/pudo/dataset)

In short, **dataset** makes reading and writing data in databases as simple as reading and writing JSON files.
