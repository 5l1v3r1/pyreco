krTheme Sphinx Style
====================

This repository contains sphinx styles Kenneth Reitz uses in most of
his projects. It is a drivative of Mitsuhiko's themes for Flask and Flask related
projects.  To use this style in your Sphinx documentation, follow
this guide:

1. put this folder as _themes into your docs folder.  Alternatively
   you can also use git submodules to check out the contents there.

2. add this to your conf.py: ::

	sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('_themes'))
	html_theme_path = ['_themes']
	html_theme = 'kr'

The following themes exist:

**kr**
	the standard flask documentation theme for large projects

**kr_small**
	small one-page theme.  Intended to be used by very small addon libraries.

django-crispy-form has replaced django-uni-form
===============================================


We've decided to move development on `django-uni-form` to `django-crispy-forms`_.  From now on, development on `django-uni-form` has been stopped, and any future work will be for security issues only on legacy code. 

django-uni-form
================

The best way to have Django_ DRY forms. Build programmatic reusable layouts out of components, having full control of the rendered HTML. All this without breaking the standard way of doing things in Django, so it plays nice with any other form application.

The application mainly provides:

* A filter named ``|as_uni_form`` that will render elegant div based forms. Think of it as the built-in methods: ``as_table``, ``as_ul`` and ``as_p``. You cannot tune up the output, but it is easy to start using. 
* A tag named ``{% uni_form %}`` that will render a form based on your configuration and specific layout setup. This gives you amazing power without much hassle, helping you save tons of time. 

By default all the templates were designed to work with `Uni-form`_, but you can create your own or use other bundles available, `see the docs`_ for more information.

Note
----

django-uni-form only supports Django 1.2 or higher and Python 2.5.4, Python 2.6.x and Python 2.7.x. If you need to support earlier versions of Django or Python you will need to use django-uni-form 0.7.0.
