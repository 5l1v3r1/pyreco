# Alternative Internet Contributing Guide

## As contributor

The current index reads its projects from the JSON files in `projects/`.

To add a new project, make a pull request with a JSON file according to this template:

```json
  {
    "name": "Project name",
    "description": "A description, in markdown format"
  }
```

The script used to generate the index, sources project statistics from Ohloh.net. It is possible that the metadata is incorrect due to Ohloh's search engine returning the wrong project. You can skip the Ohloh metadata for such a project, using the
following JSON structure:

```json
  {
    "name": "Project name",
    "description": "A description, in markdown format",
    "ohloh": {
      "skip": true
    }
  }
```

Alternatively, you can manually look up the project on Ohloh and get the correct Ohloh identifier for this project. You can tell the script to use that identifier with the following JSON structure:

```json
  {
    "name": "Project name",
    "description": "A description, in markdown format",
    "ohloh": {
      "id": "1234567"
    }
  }
```

## As maintainer

After a pull request is accepted, the `update.py` script should be run to update the index. 

This script reads a bunch of JSON files, finds appropriate metadata on Ohloh and writes everything neatly to a table.

To process the JSON files in a given directory and find metadata on Ohloh, use:

`python update.py -a [your-ohloh-api-key] -d [the-directory-to-store-in]`

To use the default directory ("projects"), simply omit the -d parameter:

`python update.py -a [your-ohloh-api-key]`

If you don't want to get information from Ohloh and just generate the table, omit the -a parameter:

`python update.py`

After this, the updates index should be committed to the repository.

Content addressable data is immutable, and so a semanticgraph is necessary for managing updates, annotations, reputation, andnavigational links. BaseParadigm lays the basis for a new paradigm fordata management that can be done offline as much as is desirable, andputs control over data storage, transmission, and processing back inthe hands of the user. Identity management becomes data managementrather than what it is today: contract management with third party webservices.

|Samizdat|Samizdat is a self-replicating LiveCD which creates an IPSec VPN between each newly-created LiveCD node and the system that created it.  It is thus "rhizomal" in the sense of Serval, but its objectives are more like those of arkOS: each node runs peer-to-peer services intended to replace the centralized services of github, skype, facebook, gmail, etc..  Samizdat provides strong cryptography for authentication of users over the network, and full disk encryption for installed systems, providing novice users fully-automated (zero-learning-curve) access to high-grade security.  Samizdat's installer does not ask any questions of the user except where to install.  The goal of Samizdat is to provide the benefits of public key cryptography to users who do not even understand what public key cryptography is.(Samizdat is also -- incidentally -- a generic framework for creating and managing LiveCD images for other purposes, such as managing multiple systems on a LAN, or system backup.)Send mail to samizdat@lists.riseup.net (public mailing list) or samizdat@childrenofmay.org (private email of project founder) for more information.|-|-|-|-|-|

|Samizdat|Samizdat is a self-replicating LiveCD which creates an IPSec VPN between each newly-created LiveCD node and the system that created it.  It is thus "rhizomal" in the sense of Serval, but its objectives are more like those of arkOS: each node runs peer-to-peer services intended to replace the centralized services of github, skype, facebook, gmail, etc..  Samizdat provides strong cryptography for authentication of users over the network, and full disk encryption for installed systems, providing novice users fully-automated (zero-learning-curve) access to high-grade security.  Samizdat's installer does not ask any questions of the user except where to install.  The goal of Samizdat is to provide the benefits of public key cryptography to users who do not even understand what public key cryptography is.(Samizdat is also -- incidentally -- a generic framework for creating and managing LiveCD images for other purposes, such as managing multiple systems on a LAN, or system backup.)Send mail to samizdat@lists.riseup.net (public mailing list) or samizdat@childrenofmay.org (private email of project founder) for more information.|-|-|-|-|-|

|Village Telco|[Village Telco](http://villagetelco.org) is a an easy-to-use, scalable, standards-based, wireless, local, DIY, telephone company toolkit.  Their mission is to making voice and data communication affordable and accessible to anyone.|-|-|-|-|-|
|STEED|[STEED](http://g10code.com/steed.html) is a protocol for opportunistic email encryption, featuring automatic key generation and distribution.|-|-|-|-|-|
|PeerCDN|[PeerCDN](https://peercdn.com/) automatically serves a site's static resources (images, videos, and file downloads) over a peer-to-peer network made up of the visitors currently on the site.|-|-|-|-|-|
|Peersm|[Peerm](http://www.peersm.com/) Anonymous P2P inside browsers, no installation, encrypted and secure. The browsers are talking the Tor protocol extended to P2P and are connecting to the nodes using WebSockets, multi-sources and streaming are supported. The final goal is to build a complete serverless P2P where anonymizer nodes are inside the browsers too relaying the traffic, using WebRTC.|-|-|-|-|-|
|unSYSTEM|[unSYSTEM](http://unsystem.net/) is a collective dedicated to creating popular tools that promote privacy, independence, and integrity in contradistinction to those used for mass surveillance and suppression.  Software projects include [Libbitcoin](https://libbitcoin.dyne.org/), [SX](https://sx.dyne.org/), and [Lorea](#Lorea).|-|-|-|-|-|
|Grand Decentral Station|[Grand Decentral Station](http://decentralize.it) is a concept for a server OS that enables designers and developers to build beautiful and secure self-hosted applications for everyone.|-|-|-|-|-|
|Samizdat|Samizdat is a self-replicating LiveCD which creates an IPSec VPN between each newly-created LiveCD node and the system that created it.  It is thus "rhizomal" in the sense of Serval, but its objectives are more like those of arkOS: each node runs peer-to-peer services intended to replace the centralized services of github, skype, facebook, gmail, etc..  Samizdat provides strong cryptography for authentication of users over the network, and full disk encryption for installed systems, providing novice users fully-automated (zero-learning-curve) access to high-grade security.  Samizdat's installer does not ask any questions of the user except where to install.  The goal of Samizdat is to provide the benefits of public key cryptography to users who do not even understand what public key cryptography is.(Samizdat is also -- incidentally -- a generic framework for creating and managing LiveCD images for other purposes, such as managing multiple systems on a LAN, or system backup.)Send mail to samizdat@lists.riseup.net (public mailing list) or samizdat@childrenofmay.org (private email of project founder) for more information.|-|-|-|-|-|
|Younity|[Younity](http://getyounity.com/) is a "personal cloud" that lets users share their files between their devices, without uploading them to one centralised server.|-|-|-|-|-|
|PageKite|[PageKite](https://pagekite.net/) is a dynamic reverse proxy designed to allow hosting of live (web-)servers on devices that are mobile, stuck behind strict firewalls or otherwise lack public IPs.|-|-|-|-|-|
|PeerServer|[PeerServer](http://www.peer-server.com/) is a peer-to-peer client server using WebRTC, where your browser acts as a server for other browsers across WebRTC peer-to-peer data channels.|-|-|-|-|-|

# Resources

More general resources on the movement to redecentralise the internet. (Also called the Indie Web movement). If it's not a link to a specific project, it belongs here.

## Techniques and ideas

* A proposal for [protection against identity theft](http://codeforcode.com/blog/2013/9/21/how-to-do-online-accounts-better) that works by decentralizing the storage of personal information. Using such a strategy would make websites less enticing targets for hackers and would allow users to be in control of where and how their personal information is stored.
* [DissidentX](https://github.com/bramcohen/DissidentX) is a steganographic framework by Bram Cohen, which can be used to hide messages into common files, with various encoders (for specific filetypes and/or techniques) and a single decoder:

    > The primary use case for DissidentX is encoding messages in files on the web.
    >
    > There should be a utility which scans all objects the user's web browser downloads (html files, images, css files, etc.) for messages using all of the keys the user has entered. Someone sending messages to that person provides a web service where users who have widely viewed web sites can upload their files and get back slightly modified version with messages steganographically added.
    >
    > The web users should not be able to read what the messages are, and it should be possible for the service doing the encoding to not have to keep messages in plaintext.


## Online articles

Articles and blog posts.

* [Meet the Hackers Who Want to Jailbreak the Internet](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/08/indie-web/) - an article on wired.com about the Indie Web.

## Web Communities

Online communities connected with these ideas.

### Meta Projects

Projects representing the idea as a whole, rather than working on a specific software implementation.

* [Federated Social Web Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/fedsocweb/) - A community sub-group of the World Wide Web Consortium on the 'Federated Social Web'.
* [IndieWebCamp](http://indiewebcamp.com/) - 'a 2-day creator camp focused on growing the independent web'.
* [Redecentralise](http://redecentralize.org/) - a website which publishes video interviews with people working on decentralised internet software.

### Forums

### Email Lists

* [Federated Social Web group list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-fedsocweb/). The email list of the w3c's Federated Social Web Community Group (see above).
