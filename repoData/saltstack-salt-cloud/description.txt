Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

What Salt release includes ``salt-cloud``?
    Salt will include native ``salt-cloud`` in the `Salt Hydrogen release`__.

    .. __: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues?milestone=39

What does this mean for the future of ``salt-cloud``?
    One fewer dependency.

    ``salt-cloud`` will continue to operate in the same way and the config
    files will live in the same location as before. The only end-user
    difference is ``salt-cloud`` will not need to be installed as a separate
    package.

What will happen to the ``salt-cloud`` repository and issue tracker?
    We will leave the ``salt-cloud`` repository in place on GitHub for the
    foreseeable future. It will contain this deprecation notice and serve as a
    historical reference.

Has the commit history and authorship for ``salt-cloud`` been lost?
    **No!**

    We have merged these two repositories using ``git mv`` followed by a
    regular ``git merge`` that preserves all the rich Git history and
    authorship of ``salt-cloud``. All commits made to ``salt-cloud`` can be
    referenced using the exact same SHA1 in the Salt repository.

    In order to view the full history of a file that came from the
    ``salt-cloud`` repository from within the Salt repository use the
    ``--follow`` flag in Git. Unfortunately, at the time of writing, GitHub's
    history view does not include this flag. For example, to view the full
    history of the ``ec2`` driver::

        git log --follow path/to/clouds/ec2.py

    Note, any commit messages that reference GitHub issues from a commit from
    ``salt-cloud`` will get confused and link to the corresponding issue in the
    Salt repository (if there is one of that same issue number).

==========
Salt Cloud
==========

Salt Cloud is a tool for provisioning salted minions across various cloud
providers. Currently supported providers are:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - Amazon EC2
    - GoGrid
    - HP Cloud (using OpenStack)
    - Joyent
    - Linode
    - OpenStack
    - Rackspace (using OpenStack)
    - Parallels
    - DigitalOcean
    - IBM Smart Cloud Enterprise
    - SoftLayer

The salt-cloud command can be used to query configured providers, create VMs on
them, deploy salt-minion on those VMs and destroy them when no longer needed.

Salt Cloud requires Salt to be installed, but does not require any Salt daemons
to be running. However, if used in a salted environment, it is best to run Salt
Cloud on the salt-master, so that it can properly lay down salt keys when it
deploys machines, and then properly remove them later. If Salt Cloud is run in
this manner, minions will automatically be approved by the master; no need to
manually authenticate them later.
