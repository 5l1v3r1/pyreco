Scrapy documentation quick start guide
======================================

This file provides a quick guide on how to compile the Scrapy documentation.


Setup the environment
---------------------

To compile the documentation you need the following Python libraries:

 * Sphinx
 * docutils
 * jinja

If you have setuptools available the following command will install all of them
(since Sphinx requires both docutils and jinja)::

    easy_install Sphinx


Compile the documentation
-------------------------

To compile the documentation (to classic HTML output) run the following command
from this dir::

    make html

Documentation will be generated (in HTML format) inside the ``build/html`` dir.


View the documentation
----------------------

To view the documentation run the following command::

    make htmlview

This command will fire up your default browser and open the main page of your
(previously generated) HTML documentation.


Start over
----------

To cleanup all generated documentation files and start from scratch run::

    make clean

Keep in mind that this command won't touch any documentation source files.
