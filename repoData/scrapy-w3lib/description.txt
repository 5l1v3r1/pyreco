Overview
========

This is a Python library of web-related functions, such as:

* remove comments, or tags from HTML snippets
* extract base url from HTML snippets
* translate entites on HTML strings
* convert raw HTTP headers to dicts and vice-versa
* construct HTTP auth header
* converting HTML pages to unicode
* RFC-compliant url joining
* sanitize urls (like browsers do)
* extract arguments from urls

Modules
=======

The w3lib package consists of four modules:

* ``w3lib.url`` - functions for working with URLs
* ``w3lib.html`` - functions for working with HTML
* ``w3lib.http`` - functions for working with HTTP
* ``w3lib.encoding`` - functions for working with character encoding

``pip install w3lib``

Release notes

See the `NEWS file`_.

Documentation
=============

For more information, see the code and tests. The functions are all documented
with docstrings.

Tests
=====

`nose`_ is the preferred way to run tests. Just run: ``nosetests`` from the
root directory to execute tests using the default Python interpreter.

`tox`_ could be used to run tests for all supported Python versions.
Install it (using 'pip install tox') and then run ``tox`` from
the root directory - tests will be executed for all available
Python interpreters.

History
=======

The code of w3lib was originally part of the `Scrapy framework`_ but was later
stripped out of Scrapy, with the aim of make it more reusable and to provide a
useful library of web functions without depending on Scrapy.
