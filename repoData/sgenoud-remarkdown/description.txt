# remarkdown

A markdown parser based on `docutils`

**Note that this code is still alpha, some markdown features might not work yet**

## Why another markdown library?

remarkdown is not just only another markdown library. It mostly contains a parser
that outputs a [`docutils` document tree][docutils]. The different scripts
bundled then use `docutils` for generation of different types of documents.

Why is this important? Many python tools (mostly for documentation creation)
rely on `docutils`. But `docutils` only supports a ReStructuredText syntax. For
instance [this issue][sphinx-issue] and [this StackOverflow
question][so-question] show that there is an interest in allowing `docutils` to
use markdown as an alternative syntax.

The remarkdown PEG is heavily inspired by [peg-markdown by John
MacFarlane][peg-md].
