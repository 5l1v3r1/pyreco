* Added new container environment variable to specify the number of Celery workers: `CELERY_WORKERS` (still defaults to 4)
* Added a simple deployment script (Fabric) that automates the production deployment doc (https://github.com/shipyard/shipyard/wiki/Deployment#shipyard-production-deployment)
* Added ability to specify container hostname
* Added support for Docker links


# Shipyard [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/shipyard/shipyard.png?label=ready)](http://waffle.io/shipyard/shipyard)
Shipyard is a web UI for http://docker.io

# Quickstart
Use the [Quickstart](https://github.com/shipyard/shipyard/wiki/QuickStart) to get
started.

# Help
To report issues please use [Github](https://github.com/shipyard/shipyard/issues)

There is also an IRC channel setup on Freenode:  `irc.freenode.net` `#shipyard`

To deploy a local Shipyard stack:

`docker run -i -t -v /var/run/docker.sock:/docker.sock shipyard/deploy setup`

You should be able to login to http://localhost:8000.  You will need to setup
the [Shipyard Agent](https://github.com/shipyard/shipyard-agent) to see containers,
 images, etc.

Username: admin
Password: shipyard

# Dev Setup
Shipyard uses [Fig](http://orchardup.github.io/fig/) for an easy development environment.  Visit that link first to setup Fig.  Then continue:

* `fig up -d redis router lb db`
* `fig run app python manage.py syncdb --noinput`
* `fig run app python manage.py migrate`
* `fig run app python manage.py createsuperuser`
* `fig up app`
* `fig up worker` (in separate terminal to see output)
* Open browser to localhost:8000 for Shipyard and localhost for the LB (you must not have anything else running on port 80)

To rebuild the app image (if you make changes to the `Dockerfile`, etc.):

* `fig build app`
* `fig build worker`

Then restart the app and worker containers as explained above.

# Features

* Multiple host support
* Create / Delete containers
* View Images
* Build Images (via uploaded Dockerfile or URL)
* Import repositories
* Private containers
* Container metadata (description, etc.)
* Applications: bind containers to applications that are setup with [hipache](https://github.com/dotcloud/hipache)
* Attach container (terminal emulation in the browser)
* Container recovery (mark container as "protected" and it will auto-restart upon fail/destroy/stop)
* RESTful API
* ...more coming...

* Note: for attaching to containers you must have access to the docker host.  This
will change in the future.

# API
Shipyard also has a RESTful JSON based API.

See https://github.com/shipyard/shipyard/wiki/API for API details.

# Applications
Applications are groups of containers that are accessible by a domain name.  The easiest
way to test this is to add some local `/etc/hosts` entries for fake domains pointed to `10.10.10.25` (the vagrant vm).  For example, add the following to `/etc/hosts`:

```
10.10.10.25 foo.local
```

Then you can create a new application with the domain `foo.local`.  Attach one or more containers and then access http://foo.local in your browser and it should hit Hipache and be routed to the containers.

For more info on applications, see [here](https://github.com/shipyard/shipyard/wiki/Applications)
