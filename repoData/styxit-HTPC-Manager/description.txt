CherryPy Tutorials
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a series of tutorials explaining how to develop dynamic web
applications using CherryPy. A couple of notes:

  - Each of these tutorials builds on the ones before it. If you're
    new to CherryPy, we recommend you start with 01_helloworld.py and
    work your way upwards. :)

  - In most of these tutorials, you will notice that all output is done
    by returning normal Python strings, often using simple Python
    variable substitution. In most real-world applications, you will
    probably want to use a separate template package (like Cheetah,
    CherryTemplate or XML/XSL).


This is from PyDispatcher <http://pydispatcher.sf.net>

It was moved here because installation of PyDispatcher conflicts with
RuleDispatch (they both use the dispatch top-level module), and I
thought it would be easier to just put it here.  Also, PyDispatcher is
small and stable and doesn't need updating often.

If the name conflict is resolved in the future, this package can go
away.
