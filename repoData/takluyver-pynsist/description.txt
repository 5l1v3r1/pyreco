This is an example that uses binary packages.

To make the installer on a non-Windows system, download the pygame installer
for 32-bit Python 3.4 (win32-py3.4) from here:
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame

Open it up with an archive tool, and extract the pygame folder from PLATLIB.
Place it in a folder called pynsist_pkgs, and pynsist will use it in preference
to the files it finds on your system.

To make the installer on a non-Windows system, download the PyQt4 installer from here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqt/files/PyQt4/PyQt-4.10.4/PyQt4-4.10.4-gpl-Py3.3-Qt4.8.5-x32.exe

Open it up with an archive tool, and extract the PyQt4 folder and sip.pyd from
Lib/site-packages. Place them in a folder called pynsist_pkgs, and pynsist will
use them in preference to the files it finds on your system.

pynsist is a tool to build Windows installers for your Python applications. The
installers bundle Python itself, so you can distribute your application to
people who don't have Python installed.

At present, pynsist requires Python 3.3 or above, or Python 2.7.

For more information, see `the documentation <http://pynsist.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_
and `the examples <https://github.com/takluyver/pynsist/tree/master/examples>`_.

Quickstart
----------

1. Get the tools. Install `NSIS <http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download>`_, and
   then install pynsist from PyPI by running ``pip install pynsist``.

2. Write a config file ``installer.cfg``, like this:

   .. code-block:: ini
   
       [Application]
       name=My App
       version=1.0
       # How to launch the app - this calls the 'main' function from the 'myapp' package:
       entry_point=myapp:main
       icon=myapp.ico

       [Python]
       version=3.4.0

       [Include]
       # Importable packages that your application requires, one per line
       packages = requests
            bs4
            html5lib

       # Other files and folders that should be installed
       files = LICENSE
           data_files/

3. Run ``pynsist installer.cfg`` to generate your installer. If ``pynsist`` isn't
   found, you can use ``python -m nsist installer.cfg`` instead.
