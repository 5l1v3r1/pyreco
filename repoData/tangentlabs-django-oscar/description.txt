The following files are generated by Less, do not edit them directly:

* styles.css
* responsive.css
* dashboard.css
============
CSS and Less
============

Oscar uses Less to build its CSS files.  Each of the 3 main CSS files has a
corresponding less file::

    styles.less -> styles.css
    responsive.less -> responsive.css
    dashboard.less -> dashboard.css

Oscar's CSS uses Less files from `Twitter's Bootstrap project`_ - these are housed
in the bootstrap folder.

.. _`Twitter's Bootstrap project`: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/

Compiling less
--------------

You can compile the CSS from the root of the project using a make target::
    
    make css

=======
Statics
=======

Oscar ships with a set of static files (js/css/less/images).  These are used on
the sandbox and demo sites.  

When building your own project, it is not recommended to use these files
straight from the package.  Rather, you should take a static copy of the
``oscar/static/oscar`` folder and commit it into your project.  

This is because the link with upstream project is not really helpful for
statics.  When you upgrade Oscar, the updated CSS files may not work with your
mark-up, causing unnecessary work on your behalf.  It's better to have complete
control of the statics within your project.
==================
Template Structure
==================

Markup
------

Template markup for the most part has been written in accordance with Twitter Bootstrap.
Documentation on Bootstrap HTML markup and classes used see (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html).

Layouts
-------

Currently there are 5 different layouts that extend the base.html

layout.html :
    For single column layouts
* detail.html
* basket.html
* flatpages/default.html

layout_2_col.html :
    For two column layouts whereby first column is subservient (aside) to the main column
* home.html
* browse.html

layout_3_col.html :
    For three column layouts whereby first and third columns are subservient (aside) to the main middlecolumn
* Currently NOT used

checkout/layout.html :
  For the checkout pages, removes the main navigation and uses a single column by default
* checkout.html
* gateway.html
* thank_you.html

dashboard/layout.html :
  For dashboard section specifically different from the other frontend features:
* separate css
* separate js
* single column 100% page width

Forms
-----

Forms are rendered using either of these two partial templates

* form_fields.html
* form_fields_inline.html

form_fields.html :
    This is used for the majority of the forms in the frontend and dashboard, using a horizontal label / field stack

form_fields_inline.html :
    Used for smaller forms to reduced screen space (mainly in the dashboard section for search forms)

Partials form_fields::

    'include "partials/form_fields.html" with form=form'

Partials form_fields_inline::

    'include "partials/form_fields_inline.html" with form=form'

Conventions
-----------

Template names should use underscores, not hyphens.

Mark-up guide
=============

Forms
-----

Forms should be marked-up as::

    <form method="post" action="." class="form-horizontal">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {% include 'partials/form_fields.html' %}
        <div class="form-actions">
            <button class="btn btn-large btn-primary" type="submit">Save</button>
            or <a href="{{ some_url }}">cancel</a>
        </div>
    </form>

The ``.form-actions`` class aligns the buttons with the fields and adds a gray
background.

Alternatively, use::
    
    <form method="post" action="." class="form-horizontal">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {% include 'partials/form_fields.html' %}
        <div class="control-group">
            <div class="controls">
                <button class="btn btn-large btn-primary" type="submit">Save</button>
                or <a href="{{ some_url }}">cancel</a>
            </div>
        </div>
    </form>

The ``.control-group`` class aligns the buttons with the fields.

Domain-driven e-commerce for Django
===================================

Oscar is an e-commerce framework for Django designed for building domain-driven
sites.  It is structured such that any part of the core functionality can be
customised to suit the needs of your project.  This allows a wide range of
e-commerce requirements to be handled, from large-scale B2C sites to complex B2B
sites rich in domain-specific business logic.

the sandbox and demo sites.  

When building your own project, it is not recommended to use these files

control of the statics within your project.
===========
Oscar sites
===========

Oscar ships with two working Django projects that use Oscar:

Sandbox
-------

This is a vanilla install of Oscar with as little customisation as possible to
get a basic site working.  It's really intended for local development and QA.

It does have a few customisations:

* A "gateway" page that lets users create a dashboard user so they can play with
  the dashboard.
* A profile model with a few fields, designed to test Oscar's account section
  which should automatically allow the profile fields to be edited.

It is deployed hourly to: http://latest.oscarcommerce.com

Demo
----

This is intended to show off some of Oscar's features, such as:

* Customising core models
* Overriding templates and CSS: changing the site appearance
* Integrating with some of Oscar's extensions

Most of this is still a work-in-progress.

============
Sandbox site
============

This site is deployed to two locations:

http://sandbox.oscar.tangentlabs.co.uk/
---------------------------------------

This site is used for testing the vanilla Oscar functionality, that is, Oscar
without any customisation.  It is not a demo site for clients or potential Oscar
users.  It is built automatically from the HEAD of the master branch every 20
minutes.

http://qa.oscar.tangentlabs.co.uk/
----------------------------------

This site is for Tangent's QA team to test release candidates.  Like the sandbox
site, it is not customised but is built from fixed tags rather than continually
updated.
=======
US site
=======

This is a simple Oscar site configured to sell products in USD with taxes only
calculated during checkout.
