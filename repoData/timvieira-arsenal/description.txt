The arsenal is an assortment of python utilities for math, natural language
processing / information extraction, systems programming, scripting/hacks,
software development.

This project is a bit large and slightly messy. Part of this is because I
dislike installing software on all of the machine I used (yes, even with tools
as awesome as pip, easy_install, and virtualenv). One of my favorite passtimes
is finding the "utils.py" of open-source projects and borrowing ideas. If you
find any code missing proper attribution please let me know!

There are a lot of files here. I'd like to highlight a few of my most useful /
favorite things:

Highlights
----------

- misc.py
    A "dumping ground" for odd and ends. I normally drop things in here and later
    move them elsewhere if the turn out to be useful.

- robust.py
    utilities such as ``timelimit`` and ``retry`` to help "robustify" your code.

- iterextras.py
    the most useful things here are ``iterview`` and ``sliding_window``

- fsutils.py
    utilities for working with the file system like atomic file writes and
    recursively listing directories (like UNIX find)

- nlp/
    Contains many text-processing utilities useful in natural language
    processing. This directory has gotten big enough to almost become its own
    project. I've got some pretty good regular expression for scraping dates.

- debug/
    I'm a big fan of ``debug.utils.ip``.

    + breakin.py
      ripped out bzr's infamous breakin feature. enabling this allows the user
      to send a SIGQUIT or SIGBREAK signal to a running process and get an
      interactive shell or pdb session AND even resume the process!

- cache/
    contains the ``memoize`` decorator and even a persistence shelve-based variant.
