This provides an OSX theme for GTK that will emulate the look of Leopard
(OSX 10.5). It doesn't use native colours, but should integrate well with the
default theme of Leopard. It was obtained here:
http://gnomestyle.blogspot.com/2007/10/new-leopard-theme.html
In reality it only mimicks the default theme, and will therefore work on Linux
as well.

A native theme for Aqua is advertised here:
http://people.imendio.com/richard/archives/2008/02/native_mac_them_1.html
This should query Aqua for the real colours used by the user, but is said to not
be very stable yet. It might be worthwhile to investigate at some stage.

These files are screenshots used for the AppData files. They can be used for
other purposes, but other screenshots can't be used for AppData in general as
they need specific sizes.


Updating translations
---------------------
from po/

./intltool-update --pot
./intltool-update xy

Generating the .xml and .desktop files
--------------------------------------
from package /

./maketranslations

This will use the .po files and .xml.in and 
.desktop.in to create a .xml and .desktop file

Lite Versions
-------------
For languages with no upstream translations of certain packages we
include a 'lite' version. This contains only the strings needed
by Virtaal, nothing more.  Translating these will ensure that
the user has an end to end localised experience.

Do not translate these if upstream exists.  We'll package upstream
package translation rather than your lite versions if they exist. Ideally
you should get these light versions upstreamed.

Currently we translate lite versions for:
* GTK - http://l10n.gnome.org/module/gtk+ (scroll down to UI translations)
* gtkspell - http://translationproject.org/domain/gtkspell.html
* Glib - http://l10n.gnome.org/module/glib/

Introduction
------------
Virtaal is a graphical program for doing translation. It is meant to be easy
to use and powerful at the same time. Although the initial focus is on software
translation (localisation or l10n), we definitely intend it to be useful for
several purposes.

Installation
------------
The easiest way for most users to install Virtaal is through the provided
packages, or through the packaging system of their distribution. On the
Virtaal website there should be packages for Windows and several other systems.
If you want to install from source code, you will need to ensure you have all
the dependencies. For more information on building Virtaal to install it
yourself, please consult the website here:
http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/virtaal/building

Note that you will probably already want the Translate Toolkit installed and
working before you attempt to install Virtaal.

Reporting bugs
--------------
Please report bugs by clicking on '*Help->Report bug...*' from within Virtaal
(this requires a Bugzilla account).  Alternatively report directly using this
URL: <http://bugs.locamotion.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Virtaal>

Taking the time to create a bugzilla account will help ensure that you can track
progress, provide feedback and allows others to see your bug report.

Design principles
-----------------
* Good looking
* Optimise for the most frequent use cases
* No necessity for mouse
* The most important information must be visible by default
* Only relevant (actionable) widgets should be shown
* Maximum functionality without setup
