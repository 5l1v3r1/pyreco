Stuff

## v1.1.3:

* Cleaning up the cookbook

## v0.1.0:

* Initial version

Description
===========

Installs memcached-1.2.5 with the patch required for lesswrong

Requirements
============

Attributes
==========

The following are node attributes passed to the template for the runit
service.

* `memcached[:memory]` - maximum memory for memcached instances.
* `memcached[:user]` - user to run memcached as.
* `memcached[:port]` - port for memcached to listen on.
* `memcached[:listen]` - IP address for memcached to listen on.

Usage
=====

Simply set the attributes and it will configure the
/etc/memcached.conf file. If you want to use multiple memcached
instances, you'll need to modify the recipe to disable the startup
script and the template in the default recipe.

Use the define, memcached_instance, to set up a runit service for the
named memcached instance.

    memcached_instance "myproj"

The recipe also reads in whether to start up memcached from a
/etc/default/memcached "ENABLE_MEMCACHED" setting, which is "yes" by
default.

This directory exists so that Subversion-based projects can share a single
copy of the ``ez_setup`` bootstrap module for ``setuptools``, and have it
automatically updated in their projects when ``setuptools`` is updated.

For your convenience, you may use the following svn:externals definition::

    ez_setup svn://svn.eby-sarna.com/svnroot/ez_setup

You can set this by executing this command in your project directory::

    svn propedit svn:externals .

And then adding the line shown above to the file that comes up for editing.
Then, whenever you update your project, ``ez_setup`` will be updated as well.
