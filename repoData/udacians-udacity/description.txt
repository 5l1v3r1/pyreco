Simple game to learn Object Oriented programming concepts

Run by issuing a command : python game.py

There are currently several development branches that you can check out:
Some of them need additional graphic libraries (PyGame and PIL)

GUI mods:
--------

    git checkout kaprice
    python gfx.py

    git checkout gdimike
    python game.py

    git checkout piffio
    python game.py -g sdl # or '-g txt' - choice of gui

Functionality mods:
------------------

    git checkout heinzema # added Equipable Items and Chests
    python game.py

    git checkout alexk      # magic and AI related improvements and some additions,
                            # which make the game nicer(Castle, Buttrefly, Fountains, Trees etc.).                       
    python game_Tkinter.py  # ANCII and PyGame versions aren't supported yet, but Tkinter looks and works pretty nice.

A small command-line application to make downloading programming quizzes and submitting solutions for Udacitys Computer Science classes easier.


== 2. EXAMPLES ==

Downloading all programming quizzes for course CS262 (Downloaded files will be placed as ./Course/UnitName/Part.py where . is current folder)

    python pquiz.py --download --course cs262
                     

Submitting solution to CS262 Problem Set 5 Quiz 5 (you will be asked to log in)

    python pquiz.py --submit --file "./cs262/Problem Set 5/5.py"

OR (if the file wasn't downloaded using this tool)

    python pquiz.py --submit --file "./cs262/Problem Set 5/5.py" --course cs262 --unit "Problem Set 5" --part 5

    
Downloading all programming quizzes for course CS262 Problem set 5
