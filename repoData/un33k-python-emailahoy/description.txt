    1. easy_install python-emailahoy
    2. pip install python-emailahoy
    3. git clone http://github.com/un33k/python-emailahoy
        a. cd python-emailahoy
        b. run python setup.py
    4. wget https://github.com/un33k/python-emailahoy/zipball/master
        a. unzip the downloaded file
        b. cd into python-emailahoy-* directory
        c. run python setup.py

How to use
=================

``Use the class for more control & more granular return status``

    from emailahoy import VerifyEmail
    e = VerifyEmail()
    status = e.verify_email_smtp(
                        email='test@example.com',
                        from_host='mydomain.com',
                        from_email='verify@mydomain.com'
                    )
    if e.was_found(status):
        print >> sys.stderr, "Found:", status
    elif e.not_found(status):
        print >> sys.stderr, "Not Found:", status
    else:
        print >> sys.stderr, "Unverifiable:", status

``Use the shorthand function for quick check``

    if verify_email_address('test@example.com'):

    else:
        print >> sys.stderr, "Don't care"
