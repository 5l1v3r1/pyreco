# Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Please bear the following in mind:

- Base your changes on the dev branch. If necessary, rebase against `dev` before opening a pull request
- Follow [PEP 8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), and the prevailing cultural conventions
- In particular, use spaces for indentation, and ensure that all methods have a proper docstring. Please don't use Doctest
- If at all possible, don't add dependencies. If it's unavoidable, ensure that the dependency is maintained, and supported. Ensure that you add your dependency to [setup.py](setup.py)
- Run the tests, and ensure that they pass. If you're adding a feature, try to add a test
- If your pull request is a feature, document it
- One feature per pull request
- If possible, [squash](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Squashing-Commits) your commits before opening a pull request, unless it makes no sense to do so
- If in doubt, comment your code

``` python
from pyzotero import zotero
zot = zotero.Zotero(library_id, library_type, api_key)
items = zot.top(limit=5)
# we've retrieved the latest five top-level items in our library
# we can print each item's item type and ID
for item in items:
    print('Item Type: %s | Key: %s') % (item['itemType'], item['key'])
```

# Description #
Pyzotero is a Python wrapper for the [Zotero read and write APIs (currently API v1)][1]. You'll require a library ID and access key, which can be set up [here][2].

See [Read The Docs][3] for full documentation of available Pyzotero methods, code examples, and sample output.

# Installation #

* using [pip][10]: `pip install pyzotero` 
* From a local clone, if you wish to install Pyzotero from a specific branch: 

Example:

``` bash
git clone git://github.com/urschrei/pyzotero.git
cd pyzotero
git checkout dev
pip install .
```

Installation using `easy_install` may be successful, but is neither tested nor officially supported â€“ pip is the preferred method.

# Python 3 #

Python 3.3 is currently experimentally supported.

## Testing ##

Run `tests.py` in the `pyzotero` directory, or, using [Nose][7], `nosetests` from the top-level directory.

## Issues ##

Pyzotero remains in development as of March 2014. The latest commits can be found on the [dev branch][9]. If you encounter an error, please open an issue.

## Pull Requests ##
