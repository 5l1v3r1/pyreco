## NappTestFlight Module for Appcelerator Titanium 

This is a Test Flight module currently based on TestFlight SDK. This module supports iOS and Android. (The android version is still in beta.)


### Download

**Find the newest version in the dist folder** 


## Notice

Testflight does not know that you are using Appcelerator Titanium. So it will come up with a message saying that it cannot find your token. Thats okay. It will still work.

![Warning](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BVEs_lFCQAAdywd.png)

To prevent getting this warning every time, set the tokens in your `tiapp.xml` like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ti:app xmlns:ti="http://ti.appcelerator.org">
    <property name="testflight.ios" type="string">9cad1045-56be-4176-ad4a-029c59d5f488</property>
    <property name="testflight.android" type="string">870aafec-bb4c-4777-91da-014c2d9ffd20</property>
</ti:app>
```

Then in your `app.js` do:

```javascript
require('dk.napp.testflight').takeOff(Ti.App.Properties.getString(Ti.Platform.name === 'iPhone OS' ? 'testflight.ios' : 'testflight.android'));
```
