SYNOPSIS

	pyfiglet is a full port of FIGlet (http://www.figlet.org/) into pure
	python. It takes ASCII text and renders it in ASCII art fonts (like
	the title above, which is the 'block' font).

FAQ

	Q. Why? WHY?!
	A. I was bored. Really bored.

	Q. What the hell does this do that FIGlet doesn't?
	A. Not much, except allow your font collection to live
           in one big zipfile. The point of this code is to embed
           dynamic figlet rendering in Python without having to
           execute an external program, although it operates on the
           commandline as well.  See below for USAGE details. You can
           think of this as a python FIGlet driver.

	Q. Does this support kerning/smushing like FIGlet?
	A. Yes, yes it does. Output should be identical to FIGlet. If
           not, this is a bug, which you should report to me!

	Q. Can I use/modify/redstribute this code?
	A. Yes, under the terms of the GPL (see LICENSE below).

	Q. I improved this code, what should I do with it?
	A. You can mail patches to <cjones@insub.org>. Particularly bugfixes.
           If you make changes to the kerning/mushing/rendering portion, PLEASE
           test it throroughly. The code is fragile and complex.


USAGE

	You can use pyfiglet in one of two ways. First, it operates on the
	commandline as C figlet does and supports most of the same options.
	Run with --help to see a full list of tweaks.  Mostly you will only
	use -f to change the font. It defaults to standard.flf.

	./pyfiglet 'text to render'

	Pyfiglet is also a library that can be used in python code:

	from pyfiglet import Figlet
	f = Figlet(font='slant', dir='/usr/local/share/figlet') # or zipfile=PATH
	print f.renderText('text to render')


	pyfiglet also supports reading fonts from a zip archive. pyfiglet
	comes with a file called fonts.zip which includes all of the default
	fonts FIGlet comes with as well as the standard collection of user-
	contributed fonts. By default, pyfiglet uses this for fonts. Specifying
	a directory (on the commandline or in the Figlet() object) will override
	this behavior. You may also specify a zipfile to use with -z or zipfile=PATH
	in the Figlet() constructor.

	If you wish to add/remove fonts or create your own font package, be aware
	that there *must* be a folder in the root of the zipfile called "fonts". You
	can examine the bunlded fonts.zip to see how it should be packaged.


AUTHOR

	pyfiglet is a *port* of FIGlet, and much of the code is directly translated
	from the C source. I optimized some bits where I could, but because the smushing
	and kerning code is so incredibly complex, it was safer and easier to port the logic
	almost exactly.  Therefore, I can't really take much credit for authorship, just
	translation. The original authors of FIGlet are listed on their website  at
	http://www.figlet.org/.

	The Python port was done by Christopher Jones <cjones@insub.org> (http://gruntle.org/).

=== Description ===
ASCII-Decorator is a simple plugin implementation of [[https://github.com/pwaller/pyfiglet|pyfiglet]] for [[www.sublimetext.com/3|Sublime Text 3]].  [[https://github.com/pwaller/pyfiglet|pyfiglet]] is a full port of [[http://www.figlet.org/|FIGlet]] into pure python.  [[http://www.figlet.org/|FIGlet]] is a program that generates text banners, in a variety of typefaces, composed of letters made up of conglomerations of smaller ASCII characters.

  # [[http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control|Package Control]]

=== Installation ===
  # (Preferred) Install via [[http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control|Package Control Plugin]] for [[www.sublimetext.com/3|Sublime Text 3]]
  ## Bring up command palette (cmd+shift+P or ctrl+shift+P)
  ### Select option: "Package Control: Install Package"
  #### Select ASCII-Decorator from the list.

  # Install via git
  ## In a shell: path to the [[www.sublimetext.com/3|Sublime Text 3]] Packages directory
  ### type: git clone https://github.com/viisual/ASCII-Decorator.git

=== Usage ===
  # You can access the plugin default font via from selecting: Menu > Edit > ASCII Decorator
  # You can access the plugin default font via the key-binding: super+shift+K or alt+shift+K

  # You can access your pre-defined favorite fonts via the view context menu or the command palette

=== Setup Font Favorites ===
You can define frequently used font configurations in the settings file under "favorite_fonts".  Only "name" and "font" are requried.  The rest of the settings override the defaults if used.
{{{
    /* Define user fonts setup for the favorite fonts menu */
    "favorite_fonts": [
        {
            "name": "Default Font",   // (required) Friendly name for font configuration
            "font": "slant",          // (required) Font
            "comment": true,          // Override default setting
            "comment_style": "block", // Override default comment style
            "width": 80,              // Override default width
