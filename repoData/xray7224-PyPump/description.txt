PyPump - Python Pump.io Library
================================

What is Pump.io?
================

Pump.io is a socially oriented federated network. It provides a way to post notes and images as well and subscribe to other people to get updates on what they post.


What's PyPump?
===============

PyPump provides an interface to the pump.io API's. The aim is to provide very natural pythonic representations of Notes, Images, People, etc... allowing you to painlessly interact with them. 


What does PyPump require?
==========================

PyPump works with:

- Python (2.6, 2.7, 3.3+)
- requests-oauthlib 0.3.0+
- requests 1.2.0+

*We provide a unified version which works with both the python 2 and python 3 versions.*

Documentation
=============

PyPump is documented. They are currently hosted on Read The Docs:

`latest docs <https://pypump.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_

Installation
============

You can install it via pip::

    $ pip install pypump

If you're using Python 2, you may wish to install the following packages for SNI support::

    $ pip install ndg-httpsclient pyopenssl pyasn1

These packages are not automatually installed due to pyopenssl being a C extension.
